What is Natural Farming? l In Conversation with Satya Tripathi Secretary-General, GASP\#\62 views\#\2022-02-09\#\dd india doordarshan live dd india live tv dd india online stream, watch dd india live\#\What is Natural Farming? In this video learn more about it.  1. Organic farming, although popular has not scaled more than 1% despite the fact that it has been there for more than 5 decades 2.

Zero Budget Farming to fight Climate Change | In Conversation | Satya Tripathi SG, GASP | DD India\#\124 views\#\2022-02-09\#\dd india doordarshan live dd india live tv dd india online stream, watch dd india live\#\Climate change that impacts agriculture and the risk of global climate breakdown  5 Biggest Challenges:  A rampant consumption has to lead to about 420 pounds per mn of carbon concentration in the atmosphere, which is actually the real measure of global warming  A study has come out that tells us that Himalayan ice in the south glacier that has formed over the last 2000 years, has actually melted in the last 25 years, which nurtures 1.6 billion people of the sub-continent.  Normally, healthy soil should have about 2.5% soil organic carbon which helps food production and agriculture produce. Across India, the average is now dropping below 2.5%.  Some studies point out that we are 50 harvests away from extinction in terms of how we produce and consume.  Countries are engaged in mindless conversation. 21 of the worst polluted cities in the world are in India now.   The lack of coherent policy thinking among those that make the decision. PM Modi has been very vocal about these things In 2019 when the UN convention on desertification, the conference of parties that happened in Delhi, the PM talked about zero budget natural farming and the FM talked about fertilizer free farming. The govt of India has vamped it up now.   Solutions: Natural farming, most popularly known as zero budget farming. It is essentially living in harmony with nature. The ancient principles of living in harmony with nature. eg: India has 160 mn hectares of cropland currently under agriculture, if the entire farmland in India switches to zero synthetic chemical farming, it is not easy but it will help not only in rebuilding our ecosystem, regenerating the health of people, but also creating the world's largest market place for clean food.
