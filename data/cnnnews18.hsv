The embers left behind by the arsonists go on to spark a huge reservation protest in the state and the emergence of a 22-year-old Patidar leader from Saurashtra who dominated the political mindscape for the next few years.  Till that point in time, Hardik Patel was a non-entity, hardly known and recognised. A commerce graduate whose father dabbled in small submersible pumps in Viramgam on the outskirts of Ahmedabad, Hardik had no political background or godfather.   #HardikPatelResigns #Congress #GujaratNews  Subscribe to our channel for the latest news updates:  https://bit.ly/CNNNEWS18  #GetCloserToTheNews with the latest headlines on politics, sports and entertainment on https://bit.ly/2Y4QccL  To stay updated on the go, download the News18 App:  ·               Google Play Store: http://bit.ly/2VcRTRc ·               Apple App Store: https://apple.co/2JceAmY   Follow us for latest news, photos & videos: ·               Facebook: http://bit.ly/2vOO22u ·               Twitter: http://bit.ly/2HdNKch ·               Instagram: http://bit.ly/2PRgfiz .

Did Congress come up with a roadmap to take on the BJP?  rohan gupta, Congress & Sanju Verma BJP share their views on #NewsEpicentre  Listen in.   The Congress is considering enforcing the ‘One family, one ticket’ formula with the exception only when another family member has been working for at least five years in the party. The party is also considering capping at five years holding of a post with a cooling off period of three years and setting up of an assessment wing to monitor performance of office bearers.  Addressing a press conference ahead of the start of the party’s ‘Chintan Shivir’ on Friday, Congress general secretary Ajay Maken said “big changes" are in store for the party organisation and it will completely transform its working style going forward.  He said a proposal is being considered that 50 per cent party positions be reserved for those less than 50 years of age in party committees at every level of the Congress organisation. He said there is unanimity on establishing mandal committees between booth and block level in party organisation.  #Congress #ChintanShivir #CongressNews   Subscribe to our channel for the latest news updates:  https://bit.ly/CNNNEWS18   #GetCloserToTheNews with the latest headlines on politics, sports and entertainment on https://bit.ly/2Y4QccL   To stay updated on the go, download the News18 App:  ·               Google Play Store: http://bit.ly/2VcRTRc ·               Apple App Store: https://apple.co/2JceAmY   Follow us for latest news, photos & videos: ·               Facebook: http://bit.ly/2vOO22u ·               Twitter: http://bit.ly/2HdNKch ·               Instagram: http://bit.ly/2PRgfiz .

A bench led by Justice DY Chandrachud will hear the petition filed by Anjuman Masjid Committee against the Varanasi Court’s order directing survey of Gyanvapi mosque.  The top court last Friday refused to grant an interim order of status quo on the survey, but agreed to consider listing the plea of a Muslim party against the survey.  The court-mandated videography survey of the Gyanvapi Masjid complex, which was carried out for the third consecutive day, concluded on Monday amid tight security. The survey of the mosque complex, which started at 8 am, concluded at around 10:15 am.  Lawyer Vishnu Jain claimed “a big victory for Hindu side" and said that a ‘shivling’ was found inside the well used for the ‘wuzu’. The lawyer also claimed that the area where the shivling has been found will be sealed. The security of the area will be handed over to the CRPF.

His death shocked the sporting world just a few weeks after Shane Warne suffered a fatal heart attack while on holiday in Thailand in March.  Former Australian cricketer Andrew Symonds has died at the age of 46 in a a single-car crash late on Saturday. The retired all-rounder died in Hervey Range, 50 km west of Townsville in far north Queensland, when his vehicle left the road and rolled, Daily Mail reported. “Emergency services attempted to revive the 46-year-old driver and sole occupant, however, he died of his injuries," Queensland Police said on Sunday morning. His former mates were shocked to hear the news and soon some of them shared their views about this tragic news. Many of them posted condolences to the former cricketer’s family. This is how the cricket world reacted.  #AndrewSymonds #AndrewSymondsDeath #AndrewSymondsDeathVideo #Shorts

The party is also considering capping at five years holding of a post with a cooling off period of three years and setting up of an assessment wing to monitor performance of office bearers.  Addressing a press conference ahead of the start of the party’s ‘Chintan Shivir’ on Friday, Congress general secretary Ajay Maken said “big changes" are in store for the party organisation and it will completely transform its working style going forward.  He said a proposal is being considered that 50 per cent party positions be reserved for those less than 50 years of age in party committees at every level of the Congress organisation. He said there is unanimity on establishing mandal committees between booth and block level in party organisation.  #Congress #ChintanShivir #CongressNews   Subscribe to our channel for the latest news updates:  https://bit.ly/CNNNEWS18   #GetCloserToTheNews with the latest headlines on politics, sports and entertainment on https://bit.ly/2Y4QccL   To stay updated on the go, download the News18 App:  ·               Google Play Store: http://bit.ly/2VcRTRc ·               Apple App Store: https://apple.co/2JceAmY   Follow us for latest news, photos & videos: ·               Facebook: http://bit.ly/2vOO22u ·               Twitter: http://bit.ly/2HdNKch ·               Instagram: http://bit.ly/2PRgfiz .
