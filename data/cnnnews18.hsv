The region is a keenly contested one between the ruling BJP and the SP-RLD alliance. While BJP is hopping to continue with its proven hold on the Jat vote bank, SP RLD is enthusiastic about the perceived jat Muslim unity in the region.   #Kerala #Karnataka #CNNNews18Live  Subscribe to our channel for the latest news updates:  https://bit.ly/CNNNEWS18  #GetCloserToTheNews with latest headlines on politics, sports and entertainment on https://bit.ly/2Y4QccL  To stay updated on the go, download the News18 App:  ·               Google Play Store: http://bit.ly/2VcRTRc ·               Apple App Store: https://apple.co/2JceAmY   Follow us for latest news, photos & videos: ·               Facebook: http://bit.ly/2vOO22u ·               Twitter: http://bit.ly/2HdNKch ·               Instagram: http://bit.ly/2PRgfiz .

Hijab Row: High Schools in Karnataka to Resume from Feb 14, PUC and Degree Colleges Thereafter Amid the Hijab row in Karnataka, the government on Thursday decided to resume classes for high school students from next week, even as Chief Minister Basavaraj Bommai stated the High Court has said students should not wear religious dress to colleges. The government’s decision to resume classes up to Standard X from February 14 and for Pre-University and Degree Colleges thereafter, came at a meeting chaired by the chief minister with his cabinet colleagues holding the Home, Primary and Secondary Education and Higher Education portfolios, and senior officials.  “The three-judge bench (of the Karnataka High Court) has said that they will hear the case on a day-to-day basis and that everyone should maintain peace, and not to wear religious dress at colleges until then (order). They have also given instruction for reopening of educational institutions,” Bommai said. Speaking to reporters here, he said, discussions were held at the meeting aimed at establishing peace at school and college campuses and creating an atmosphere for students to study together, and to maintain law and order.  “It has been decided that high school classes up to class 10 will start functioning from Monday and in the second stage PUC and degree colleges will start, the dates will be announced in the due course,” he said. The Karnataka government announced a three-day holiday on Tuesday in view of violence and tension in some schools and colleges owing to the Hijab (Islamic head scarves) versus saffron scarves face-off.

The government’s decision to resume classes up to Standard X from February 14 and for Pre-University and Degree Colleges thereafter, came at a meeting chaired by the chief minister with his cabinet colleagues holding the Home, Primary and Secondary Education and Higher Education portfolios, and senior officials.  “The three-judge bench (of the Karnataka High Court) has said that they will hear the case on a day-to-day basis and that everyone should maintain peace, and not to wear religious dress at colleges until then (order). They have also given instruction for reopening of educational institutions,” Bommai said. Speaking to reporters here, he said, discussions were held at the meeting aimed at establishing peace at school and college campuses and creating an atmosphere for students to study together, and to maintain law and order.  “It has been decided that high school classes up to class 10 will start functioning from Monday and in the second stage PUC and degree colleges will start, the dates will be announced in the due course,” he said. The Karnataka government announced a three-day holiday on Tuesday in view of violence and tension in some schools and colleges owing to the Hijab (Islamic head scarves) versus saffron scarves face-off.

They have also given instruction for reopening of educational institutions,” Bommai said. Speaking to reporters here, he said, discussions were held at the meeting aimed at establishing peace at school and college campuses and creating an atmosphere for students to study together, and to maintain law and order.  “It has been decided that high school classes up to class 10 will start functioning from Monday and in the second stage PUC and degree colleges will start, the dates will be announced in the due course,” he said. The Karnataka government announced a three-day holiday on Tuesday in view of violence and tension in some schools and colleges owing to the Hijab (Islamic head scarves) versus saffron scarves face-off.

There should not be an iota of doubt about it: UP CM and BJP leader Yogi Adityanath BJP will secure over 300 seats in UP Assembly; it is 80 vs 20 election: Yogi Adityanath 20% includes people with negative mentality who always oppose, and support mafias & criminals. After first phase of polls, it is clear that this election is truly 80 vs 20. BJP has received support from over 80% people: UP CM Yogi Adityanath It's a reaction to action. I said 80% people are with BJP & 20% always oppose us & will do so this time too. I didn't say it the context of religion or caste. 80% includes those who are happy with Govt's agenda of security & development: UP CM on his '80 vs 20' remark Every person who is a threat to public safety should fear the law. Before 2017, there were riots every 3-4 days, with curfew being in force for months. On the contrary, no riots & curfew took place in the last 5 years: UP CM Yogi Adityanath on Opposition's 'thoko raaj' allegation First phase of Assembly elections concluded peacefully. Was there any incident of violence in UP? Earlier, riots took place, anarchy prevailed & hooliganism was at its peak. Do polls happen in Bengal as peacefully?: UP CM on his 'UP will become Kerala, Bengal' remarks Under PM's leadership & with public blessings, double-engine Govt will return to power in UP. This election has already moved towards 80 vs 20. Gloomy environment prevails in SP, BSP & Congress camps after first phase of polls. BJP is achieving target of 300-mark: UP CM Even Akhilesh doesn't want Azam Khan to come out of jail because it will pose a threat to his position. State Govt has nothing to do with these cases whether they are related to Azam Khan or anyone else. It is the court that grants bail: UP CM Yogi Adityanath Earlier, the politics revolved around caste, religion, & family. Today, development, good governance, Garib Kalyan, villages, women, farmers, & youths are on the agenda: UP CM Yogi Adityanath on Opposition's allegation that BJP is running away from real issues BJP has released its 'Lok Kalyan Sankalp Patra' which talks about nationalism, all-around development, & welfare of the poor. It will be implemented with full honesty. PM Modi has changed the agenda of politics in India: UP CM Yogi Adityanath The siblings (Rahul Gandhi and Priyanka Gandhi Vadra) are enough to ruin the Congress. No one else is needed for that: Uttar Pradesh Chief Minister Yogi Adityanath  Yogi On Owaisi and Hijab Controvercy Hijab row: CM Yogi says Constitution, not Shariat will be followed; dream of Ghazva-e-Hind will not come true even till 'Qayamat' PM has scrapped triple talaq to free that daughter, to give her rights&respect she's entitled to. To ensure respect to that daughter we say system won't be run as per Shariat but Constitution: UP CM on AIMIM chief Owaisi's 'hijab-clad woman will become PM one day' remark The system should run as per the Constitution. We can't impose our personal religious beliefs & choices on the country & its institutions. Can I ask all employees in UP to wear 'bhagwa'? Dress code must be enforced in schools: UP CM Yogi Adityanath on #HijabRow  #UPElections2022 #CNNNews18 #ElectionsWithNews18   Subscribe to our channel for the latest news updates:  https://bit.ly/CNNNEWS18  #GetCloserToTheNews with latest headlines on politics, sports and entertainment on https://bit.ly/2Y4QccL  To stay updated on the go, download the News18 App:  ·               Google Play Store: http://bit.ly/2VcRTRc ·               Apple App Store: https://apple.co/2JceAmY   Follow us for latest news, photos & videos: ·               Facebook: http://bit.ly/2vOO22u ·               Twitter: http://bit.ly/2HdNKch ·               Instagram: http://bit.ly/2PRgfiz .

Ukraine was once a part of USSR and became independent as the Soviet Union collapsed. India was one of the first countries to recognise Ukraine as a sovereign country in 1991 but right now the dilemma for India is to balance its equation with Russia and the US amid the growing crisis.   Ominous war clouds are looming over Ukraine. American National Security Advisor Jake Sullivan has also sounded an alarm saying that Russia can invade Ukraine any time now. But Russia out rightly rejects that it has any such intention. But Ukraine is getting more anxious by the day over Russia's military buildup and has asked for talks with Moscow with 48 hours even as the German Chancellor steps in to avert the war.  #UkraineCrisis #RussiaAttackUkraine #CNNNews18    Subscribe to our channel for latest news updates:  https://bit.ly/CNNNEWS18  #GetCloserToTheNews with latest headlines on politics, sports and entertainment on https://bit.ly/2Y4QccL  To stay updated on-the-go, download the News18 App:  ·               Google Play Store: http://bit.ly/2VcRTRc ·               Apple App Store: https://apple.co/2JceAmY   Follow us for latest news, photos & videos: ·               Facebook: http://bit.ly/2vOO22u ·               Twitter: http://bit.ly/2HdNKch ·               Instagram: http://bit.ly/2PRgfiz .

As per a report in Tribune, the accident took place at around 8:30 pm near the Singhu border which was also the center of farmer protests. Reportedly, the singer died on the way to the hospital. The report also claims that Sidhu’s body has also been sent to the Sonepat Civil Hospital for autopsy.  “Mr. Sidhu was going from Delhi to Bhatinda in Punjab when the car in which he was travelling in rammed a trailer truck," the police cited by NDTV said.  Deep Sidhu was also accused in the Red Fort violence case. He was arrested on February 9 last year in connection to the Republic Day violence case regarding which an FIR was filed against him in January 2021. However, he was granted bail on April 16.  For the unversed, the violence took place after thousands of farmers protested on the occasion of Republic Day against the then-proposed farm laws. During the violence, Sidhu had conducted a Facebook live while hoisting the pennant from the ramparts of the Red Fort. “We have only hoisted the Nishan Sahib flag on the Red Fort while exercising our democratic right to protest," Sindhu was heard saying in the video that later went viral.  Following the agitation, a section of farmers also slammed Sidhu for perverting the tractors’ rally “intentionally, as part of a conspiracy against the farmers”. However, a section of people dismissed all such allegations.  #DeepSidhu #DeepSidhuCarAccident #Trending #Shorts

Here is a report from Saifai village in UP's Etawah by @AmanKayamHai_ . In Samajwadi Party’s disastrous outing of winning just 47 seats in the 2017 elections in Uttar Pradesh, the biggest disappointment for Akhilesh Yadav was that the BJP won 23 out of the 29 seats in eight districts that are known as the ‘Yadav Belt’ in the state. The Agra-Lucknow Expressway built by Akhilesh in his term as Chief Minister connects these eight districts from Firozabad to Kannauj.  Visiting these districts, to ascertain the barometer of the election, reveals a spirited effort by the Samajwadi Party now to wrest back its bastion. “That was a wave election. Now the wave is over. We are all voting again for SP. Earlier, there was a misunderstanding in the family but now all is sorted and cordial,” says Malkhan Singh, playing a game of cards in Yadav family’s Saifai village in Etawah. #UPElections2022 #CNNNews18  Subscribe our channel for latest news updates:  https://bit.ly/CNNNEWS18  #GetCloserToTheNews with latest headlines on politics, sports and entertainment on https://bit.ly/2Y4QccL  To stay updated on-the-go, download the News18 App:  •               Google Play Store: http://bit.ly/2VcRTRc •               Apple App Store: https://apple.co/2JceAmY  Follow us for latest news, photos & videos: •               Facebook: http://bit.ly/2vOO22u •               Twitter: http://bit.ly/2HdNKch •               Instagram: http://bit.ly/2PRgfiz .

Ahead of the Punjab Assembly polls, Union Home Minister Amit Shah on Wednesday met the chief of Radha Soami Satsang Beas Baba Gurinder Singh Dhillon at Beas, around 45 km from Amritsar. Shah, who was in Punjab on Wednesday for a poll rally, took to Twitter to share the information about the meeting. “Today met Radha Soami Satsang chief Baba Baba Gurinder Singh Dhillon. For the third phase, to be held on February 20, the election watch has analysed the self-sworn affidavits of 623 of the 627 candidates, who are contesting in the 59 constituencies going to polls. At least 15% of the contestants (96), are women, compared to 12% in the first two phases.  In Samajwadi Party’s disastrous outing of winning just 47 seats in the 2017 elections in Uttar Pradesh, the biggest disappointment for Akhilesh Yadav was that the BJP won 23 out of the 29 seats in eight districts that are known as the ‘Yadav Belt’ in the state. The Agra-Lucknow Expressway built by Akhilesh in his term as Chief Minister connects these eight districts from Firozabad to Kannauj.  #PunjabPolls #UPElections2022 #CNN News18  Subscribe to our channel for the latest news updates:  https://bit.ly/CNNNEWS18  #GetCloserToTheNews with latest headlines on politics, sports and entertainment on https://bit.ly/2Y4QccL  To stay updated on the go, download the News18 App:  ·               Google Play Store: http://bit.ly/2VcRTRc ·               Apple App Store: https://apple.co/2JceAmY   Follow us for latest news, photos & videos: ·               Facebook: http://bit.ly/2vOO22u ·               Twitter: http://bit.ly/2HdNKch ·               Instagram: http://bit.ly/2PRgfiz .

AUK man became the world’s richest for a whole of seven long minutes, with a net worth nearly twice that of Tesla founder Elon Musk. Max Fosh, a YouTuber with over six lakh followers, made a full video detailing how he did it and shared it on his channel with a descriptor: Come at me Elon.  “If I created and registered a company with 10 billion shares with about unlimited money limited and sold one share for 50 pounds as an investment opportunity, that would legally value my company at 500 billion pounds, technically,” he says in the video that has amassed over 5.75 lakh views so far.  “That would make me the richest man in the world absolutely decimating my nearest rival Elon Musk,” he adds.  But there’s a catch. He could be accused of “fraudulent activities”. “That is not good,” he sighs.  In the eight-and-a-half-minute-long video, he creates a company from the scratch - Unlimited Money Limited. He is quite forthcoming in the registration process as he lists “making money” under the header “What will the company be doing?”  #ElonMusk #MaxFosh #Trending #Shorts #CNNNews18

It is also to be noted here that the embassy will remain operational and the order is only for the family members of the staff.  Earlier in the day, India issued an advisory and asked its nationals to leave the eastern European nation temporarily if their stay is not essential.

Voting for 59 assembly constituencies spread in nine districts of Uttar Pradesh to take place today in the fourth phase of the polls. The fourth phase of polling will decide the fate of 624 candidates in 59 Assembly segments in the districts of Pilibhit, Lakhimpur Kheri, Sitapur, Hardoi, Unnao, Lucknow, Rae Bareli, Banda and Fatehpur. Of the 59 seats, the BJP had won 51 in the 2017 Assembly elections, four had gone to the Samajwadi Party, and three to the Bahujan Samaj Party. The BJP's ally Apna Dal (Sonelal) had bagged one seat. Rae Bareli considered a Congress bastion will also go to the polls in this phase, with BJP's Aditi Singh in the fray from Rae Bareli. She was earlier with the Congress.  Launching a campaign for the fifth phase of the Uttar Pradesh elections, Chief Minister Yogi Adityanath on Tuesday asked people to vote for those who “protect cows and not those who kill them". He also said that the state was ruled by goons before 2017, but they were put behind the bars after the BJP government assumed power. Adityanath was campaigning in support of the BJP candidates of the Milkipur reserved Assembly constituency and Bikapur seat in Ayodhya district on Tuesday.  Bahujan Samaj Party chief Mayawati on Tuesday said if her party forms government in Uttar Pradesh those who have migrated from the state will be called back and given jobs. She lashed out at the BJP, Samajwadi Party and the Congress, holding them responsible for the lack of jobs and migration from the state.  A big industrialist earns Rs 1,000 crore daily, while a farmer cannot even make Rs 27 a day, Congress leader Priyanka Gandhi Vadra said on Monday, accusing the government of working for its “friends". She launched a no-holds barred attack not only on the BJP, but also on the Samajwadi Party (SP) and the Bahujan Samaj Party (BSP) as she drummed up support for Congress candidates in the state capital on the last day of campaigning for the fourth phase of the Uttar Pradesh assembly polls.   Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Friday addressed a public rally in poll-bound Uttar Pradesh’s Fatehpur and expressed concern over the Kushinagar incident in which 13 women and children, all girls, died after falling into a well while performing a marriage ritual. Meanwhile, Union Home Minister Amit Shah addressed a public gathering in Lakhimpur Kheri’s Mohammadi town  The chief minister promised to enhance the security of cows and other cattle if voted to power again. The farmers who rear cows will get a stipend of Rs 900 per month per cow, he announced, adding that his government will not compromise with the security of cows under any circumstances. Beginning his speech at RD Inter College, Bikapur, Adityanath took a veiled dig at Samajwadi Party (SP) chief Akhilesh Yadav and said “Babua" had not been visiting the temple at Ayodhya. “We will win all the five seats in Ayodhya, 325 seats in the state and thereby form a strong government," he said.  The White House is expected to announce a new set of sanctions against Russia after President Vladimir Putin ordered Russian troops into two separatist pro-Moscow regions in eastern Ukraine after recognizing their independence on Monday.  The arrest of 6 people in Bajrang Dal member Harsha's murder had brought some uneasy calm to Shivamogga. The police who didn't want to take any chances have extended the prohibitory orders in the town. The police are yet to clarify on what exactly was the motive even as they interrogate the six accused arrested and few others who have been detained.  #UPElections #UkraineCrisis #CNNNews18LIVE  Subscribe to our channel for the latest news updates:  https://bit.ly/CNNNEWS18  #GetCloserToTheNews with latest headlines on politics, sports and entertainment on https://bit.ly/2Y4QccL  To stay updated on the go, download the News18 App:  ·               Google Play Store: http://bit.ly/2VcRTRc ·               Apple App Store: https://apple.co/2JceAmY   Follow us for latest news, photos & videos: ·               Facebook: http://bit.ly/2vOO22u ·               Twitter: http://bit.ly/2HdNKch ·               Instagram: http://bit.ly/2PRgfiz .

Prime Minister Narendra Modi called for a “return to the path of diplomacy” and appealed for an immediate cessation of violence between Russia and Ukraine, in a telephonic conversation with President Vladimir Putin late on Thursday.

CNN and the Guardian have reported, citing US officials, that Russian forces are now just kilometers (approximately 20 miles) away from Kyiv, while a number of attacks have targeted civilian objects in the capital.  Ukraine’s president said Friday his country had been left on its own to fight Russia after the Kremlin launched a large-scale invasion that killed 130 Ukrainians in the first day. “We have been left alone to defend our state,” Volodymyr Zelensky said in a video address to the nation after midnight. “Who is ready to fight alongside us? I don’t see anyone. Who is ready to give Ukraine a guarantee of NATO membership? Everyone is afraid,” he added.  Zelensky said that 137 Ukrainians, both military personnel and civilians, had been killed since the start of the attack early Thursday. Another 316 had been wounded, he said.  Zelensky also said that Russian “sabotage groups” had entered the capital Kyiv, and urged the city’s citizens to remain vigilant and observe a curfew. The president added that he and his family remained in Ukraine, despite Russia identifying him as “target number one”. “They want to destroy Ukraine politically by taking down the head of state,” Zelensky said.  U.S. President Joe Biden said on Thursday Washington is in still unresolved “consultations” with India, when asked if Washington and Delhi were fully in sync on a response to Russia’s attack on Ukraine ahead of an expected U.N. Security Council vote.  Biden did not elaborate, but his short response to a question at a briefing at which he announced tough new sanctions on Russia over Ukraine drew attention to an awkward division between his administration and India, a country central to its efforts to push back against China’s growing power. #RussiaUkraineWar #PutinInvadesUkraine #CNNNews18LIVE #NatoOnUkraine  Putin Invades Ukraine | Russia Ukraine War LIVE Updates | CNN News18 LIVE | Joe Biden | NATO on Ukraine   live news,ukraine,russia,russia ukraine war,russia ukraine conflict,russia ukraine news,russia ukraine war live,russia ukraine live updates,russia ukraine war updates,russia ukraine live,russia ukraine news live,russia ukraine updates,live russia ukraine updates,third world war,ukraine news,ukraine news live,russian ukraine news,russia ukrain war updates,russia ukraine live news,vladimir putin,putin on ukraine,live  Subscribe our channel for latest news updates:  https://bit.ly/CNNNEWS18  #GetCloserToTheNews with latest headlines on politics, sports and entertainment on https://bit.ly/2Y4QccL  To stay updated on-the-go, download the News18 App:  ·               Google Play Store: http://bit.ly/2VcRTRc ·               Apple App Store: https://apple.co/2JceAmY   Follow us for latest news, photos & videos: ·               Facebook: http://bit.ly/2vOO22u ·               Twitter: http://bit.ly/2HdNKch ·               Instagram: http://bit.ly/2PRgfiz .

CNN and the Guardian have reported, citing US officials, that Russian forces are now just kilometers (approximately 20 miles) away from Kyiv, while a number of attacks have targeted civilian objects in the capital.  Ukraine’s president said Friday his country had been left on its own to fight Russia after the Kremlin launched a large-scale invasion that killed 130 Ukrainians in the first day. “We have been left alone to defend our state,” Volodymyr Zelensky said in a video address to the nation after midnight. “Who is ready to fight alongside us? I don’t see anyone. Who is ready to give Ukraine a guarantee of NATO membership? Everyone is afraid,” he added.  Zelensky said that 137 Ukrainians, both military personnel and civilians, had been killed since the start of the attack early Thursday. Another 316 had been wounded, he said.  Zelensky also said that Russian “sabotage groups” had entered the capital Kyiv, and urged the city’s citizens to remain vigilant and observe a curfew. The president added that he and his family remained in Ukraine, despite Russia identifying him as “target number one”. “They want to destroy Ukraine politically by taking down the head of state,” Zelensky said.  U.S. President Joe Biden said on Thursday Washington is in still unresolved “consultations” with India, when asked if Washington and Delhi were fully in sync on a response to Russia’s attack on Ukraine ahead of an expected U.N.

CNN and the Guardian have reported, citing US officials, that Russian forces are now just kilometers (approximately 20 miles) away from Kyiv, while a number of attacks have targeted civilian objects in the capital.  Ukraine’s president said Friday his country had been left on its own to fight Russia after the Kremlin launched a large-scale invasion that killed 130 Ukrainians in the first day. “We have been left alone to defend our state,” Volodymyr Zelensky said in a video address to the nation after midnight. “Who is ready to fight alongside us? I don’t see anyone. Who is ready to give Ukraine a guarantee of NATO membership? Everyone is afraid,” he added.  Zelensky said that 137 Ukrainians, both military personnel and civilians, had been killed since the start of the attack early Thursday. Another 316 had been wounded, he said.  Zelensky also said that Russian “sabotage groups” had entered the capital Kyiv, and urged the city’s citizens to remain vigilant and observe a curfew. The president added that he and his family remained in Ukraine, despite Russia identifying him as “target number one”. “They want to destroy Ukraine politically by taking down the head of state,” Zelensky said.  U.S. President Joe Biden said on Thursday Washington is in still unresolved “consultations” with India, when asked if Washington and Delhi were fully in sync on a response to Russia’s attack on Ukraine ahead of an expected U.N. Security Council vote.  Biden did not elaborate, but his short response to a question at a briefing at which he announced tough new sanctions on Russia over Ukraine drew attention to an awkward division between his administration and India, a country central to its efforts to push back against China’s growing power.  #Putin #Zelensky #RussiaUkraineWar

Satellite images taken on Monday show a Russian military convoy north of the Ukrainian capital of Kyiv that stretches for about 40 miles (64 km), substantially longer than the 17 miles (27 km) reported earlier in the day, a U.S. private company said, according to a Reuters report. Maxar Technologies also said additional ground forces deployments and ground attack helicopter units were seen in southern Belarus, less than 20 miles (32 km) north of the Ukraine border. On Monday, Russian Foreign Ministry Spokeswoman Maria Zakharova expressed confidence that NATO’s and the Western public’s silence on the situation in Donbass had resulted in a humanitarian and political disaster in Europe.  “NATO’s experiments and the deafening silence of the Western public – these are the reasons behind the humanitarian and political disaster in Europe. An end was to be put to this, since the West refused to conduct any negotiations whatsoever and welcomed aggressive statements and direct threats of Kiev puppets towards Russia,” the diplomat wrote on her Telegram channel, according to a report by RT.  Russia did not start a war; it is ending it, according to Zakharova. “Throughout these years, the Russian side has urged the international community to oppose the ongoing annihilation of the Donbass population. These are millions of people who were losing loved ones every day and were living in basements to escape the shelling,” she added. #RussiaUkraineTensions #RussiaInvadesUkraine #RussiaDeclaresWarOnUkraine

Russia’s defence ministry announced a ceasefire Saturday to allow residents of two besieged cities, including the strategic port city of Mariupol, to evacuate. “Today, March 5, from 10 am Moscow time, the Russian side declares a regime of silence and opens humanitarian corridors for the exit of civilians from Mariupol and Volnovakha,” it said.  The announcement comes after Mariupol’s mayor Vadim Boychenko said Saturday that the city was under “blockade” by Russian forces after days of “ruthless” attacks. While laying siege to Mariupol for days, Russian forces have cut its electricity, food, water, heating and transportation in the depths of winter, prompting comparisons to the Nazi blockade of Leningrad in World War II.  #Russia #Ukraine #CNNNews18  Subscribe our channel for latest news updates:  https://bit.ly/CNNNEWS18  #GetCloserToTheNews with latest headlines on politics, sports and entertainment on https://bit.ly/2Y4QccL  To stay updated on-the-go, download the News18 App:  ·               Google Play Store: http://bit.ly/2VcRTRc ·               Apple App Store: https://apple.co/2JceAmY   Follow us for latest news, photos & videos: ·               Facebook: http://bit.ly/2vOO22u ·               Twitter: http://bit.ly/2HdNKch ·               Instagram: http://bit.ly/2PRgfiz .

Ukrainian leader Volodymyr Zelensky has pleaded with the West to support a no-fly zone as his besieged country resists Moscow’s invasion, but allies have so far ruled out such a move, fearing it would escalate into a wider war with nuclear-armed Russia.  Russian President Vladimir Putin warns of “colossal and catastrophic consequences not only for Europe but also the whole world” if foreign powers attempt to establish a no-fly zone in Ukraine. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky has appealed to NATO to set up a no-fly zone but NATO chief Jens Stoltenberg rejected the call, saying it could lead to a wider war in Europe. #RussiaUkraineWar #Putin #CNNNews18   Subscribe to our channel for the latest news updates:  https://bit.ly/CNNNEWS18  #GetCloserToTheNews with latest headlines on politics, sports and entertainment on https://bit.ly/2Y4QccL  To stay updated on the go, download the News18 App:  •               Google Play Store: http://bit.ly/2VcRTRc •               Apple App Store: https://apple.co/2JceAmY   Follow us for latest news, photos & videos: •               Facebook: http://bit.ly/2vOO22u •               Twitter: http://bit.ly/2HdNKch •               Instagram: http://bit.ly/2PRgfiz .
