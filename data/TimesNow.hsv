For weeks now, the debate & protest over allowing students with hijab inside classrooms has been taking center stage in Karnataka. Right at the center of this debate are the 6-8 students from the Udupi government colleges who have been protesting against the college management's decision to not allow them inside the campus if they are unwilling to give up on the hijab inside the classroom. Karnataka High Court adjourned the hearing of the Hijab issue petition till February 14. A three-judge bench of the Karnataka High Court, comprising Chief Justice Ritu Raj Awasthi and two other judges, began hearing petitions on the hijab issue Thursday afternoon. “About 20 yrs ago, Hindu protectionist groups (in Udupi) rose coz they felt Hindu way of life was under threat. Because suddenly they saw Muslim women bringing in radical Islam which was not part of coastal Karnataka.” says Smita Prakash. Times Now - Times Now News channel examines news with in-depth analysis.

In a press conference, the Reserve bank of India governor Shaktikanta Das said that the real 2022-23 GDP growth is projected to be at 7.8%. The key interest rate has been kept unchained for the tenth time in a row which means neither our EMI will have any kind of monthly impact nor there will be any change in the interest for our bank deposits. The RBI kept a dovish stance as the Monetary Policy Committee held key policy rates unchanged, stating that it would maintain an accommodative stance for as long as it is necessary. Both repo and reverse repo rates were kept unchanged for the 10th consecutive time. The central bank said that it expects inflation to peak by the fourth quarter of FY22 and then start to moderate. Are the RBI's inflation concerns receding? Is the central bank betting on crude prices cooling off? Will repo rate hikes begin from June? We give the most conclusive monetary policy review with Abheek Barua, Chief Economist, HDFC Bank, Kaushik Das, Chief Economist - India, Deutsche Bank Research and Rahul Bajoria, Chief India Economist, Barclays.

This can be seen as a massive setback for the incumbent BJP government since Congress has geared up a lot in the past few years. However, BJP is assured that there is a scenario of 'pro-incumbency' in the state and that it will be voted back to power. Meanwhile, the state recorded a voter turnout of almost 59.5% which is a little less than the figures from 2017. People on the other hand are bothered about the prevailing issues of schools, hospitals, and employment in the state. Times Now - Times Now News channel examines news with in-depth analysis.

It said that the embassy would continue to function normally. White House principal deputy press secretary Karine Jean-Pierre has just warned that: “We are in the window when an invasion could begin at any time” about the face-off between Russia and Ukraine. Russia’s top diplomat advised President Vladimir Putin to keep talking with the West on Moscow’s security demands, a signal from the Kremlin that it intends to continue diplomatic efforts amid US warnings of an imminent Russian invasion of Ukraine. Moscow wants guarantees from the West that NATO won’t allow Ukraine and other former Soviet countries to join as members and that the alliance will halt weapons deployments to Ukraine and roll back its forces from Eastern Europe, the demands flatly rejected by the West.

The hijab row continued to simmer in Karnataka over alleged denial of entry for girl students into schools with their headscarves on in some places, as one such girl announced boycotting her exam in response to the diktat. Scenes of angry parents of such children arguing with police and school authorities and an instance of a student trying to flaunt a saffron scarf as an apparent retaliation were also reported. The Karnataka High Court, in its interim order last week restrained all the students from wearing saffron shawls, scarves, hijab and any religious flag within the classroom. High schools were reopened across the state on Monday, even as there were instances of students turning up in Hijab and burqa then, only to be denied entry or asked by officials to remove them, citing the High Court order.

The three-judge bench, hearing the case, comprises Chief Justice of Karnataka HC Ritu Raj Awasthi, Justice Krishna S Dixit, and Justice JM Khazi. While the petitioners urged the court to allow girls to attend classes in hijab and continue with their education, the government has argued that it would be necessary to find if hijab is essential in Islam. Advocate Kumar: The Education Act is a complete code. This College Development Committee is a non-existent body under the statute. It is an extra-legal authority with the power to prescribe uniforms, contrary to the act. Advocate Devadatt Kamat, for the petitioner, referred to a judgement of a South Africa court. The issue was whether a Hindu girl with roots in South India could wear a nose ring in school. He referred to the judgement which says that this case is not about uniforms, but exemptions to existing uniforms. Times Now - Times Now News channel examines news with in-depth analysis.

German air carrier Lufthansa cancelled flights to the capital, Kyiv, and to Odesa, a Black Sea port that could be a key target in an invasion. We are joined by, Amb Rtn.

The Ukraine is on the say that condemnation and sanctions are having no effect on Russia and they need military intervention. Russian powers caught the power plant, the site of the world's most terrible atomic fiasco after a "savage" fight on the primary day of Russia's intrusion of Ukraine. And Russian forces could reach Kyiv, Ukraine by Friday for a full-fledged attack. Russia pressed its invasion of Ukraine to the outskirts of the capital Friday after unleashing airstrikes on cities and military bases and sending in troops and tanks from three sides in an attack. One of our panelist, Dr Rao shared her opinion and said, "Putin doesn't want to invade whole of Ukraine because that doesn't serve his purpose of making Ukraine a buffer state between Russia & NATO".

They have been holding out in bunkers for a very long period, and there has been a serious shortage of food and water supplies to that part of the country. Almost 20,000 students have been there.

Indira’s transformation from a ‘goongi gudiya’ to a confident, assertive and decisive prime minister did not take long. Along the way, she took care to discard almost all who had mistakenly considered her a ‘dumb doll’. When her marginalized opponents said, ‘Indira hatao (Remove Indira)’, she countered them with the slogan, ‘Garibi hatao (Remove poverty)’. In fact, some of India’s greatest achievements came about when she was the prime minister. Watch this episode of The India Story, wherein we discuss the reign of Indira Gandhi.
