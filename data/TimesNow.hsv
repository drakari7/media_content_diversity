According to reports, the Shivling discovered within the disputed Gyanvapi edifice was found from the Gyanvapi premise’s Wuzukhana. Reports claim that the Shivling was discovered after the water inside a pond like well, which is used as Wuzukhana by Muslims, was pumped out of it. "Do Muslims have no reason to come together and say some invaders did something wrong to the Hindu community? That they're also sufferers as they converted and they don't want to associate with Mughals?" Says Ratan Sharda. "According to Places of Worship Act, it's clear that no one shall convert any place of worship of any denomination to another denomination or section," says Syed Aslam.

A map was planned not by the current government but was submitted in the 1930s by the British government in court. This map said the plan of the ancient temple of Vishveshwar. Right at the Centre, the map marks out the Shivling. "Aurangzeb, on his farm, states that the temple should be demolished and a masjid should be built. Whatever we found is proof that what Aurangzeb ordered has been done. Owaisi should know he cannot give a fatwa to us because there is a constitution. If 80% of Hindus decide to descend on Varanasi, this country will go into pieces.", said Dr. Subramanian Swamy, Former Rajya Sabha MP. "If the court rules that it's indeed a Shivling, the area would be a temple, not a mosque. So it was on 15th Aug 1947. Hence, it's not covered in the restrictions of the Places of Worship Act.", said Alok Kumar, International Working President, VHP.

This allegedly vindicates the claim that the mosque was built on temple land. We are joined by Rahul Easwar, an activist and Maulana Ezaz Athar, an Islamic scholar, who discuss the incident and make sense of what lies ahead for the mosque. The Gyanvapi Masjid lies next to the Kashi Vishwanath temple and thus has been a site of communal tensions for decades. The Varanasi court judgement ruled in favour of the Hindus and allowed for the opening of the Masjid for a videographic survey.

Now, a question arises  Is Navneet Rana giving a political statement on the Hanuman Chalisa row? So, Navneet Rana says that "whatever I have done is not started by me. I have inherited this from the elder generation and will pass it on to the newer generation because I believe that respecting and promoting your religion can never be wrong. I will fight till my last breath and no one should think that they can stop me. And I will not back off from my position. Hanuman Chalisa may be a reason for them to protest but for me, Hanuman Chalisa is a matter of my Aastha. I said Maharashtra's problem should be resolved that is related to the farmer, unemployment, and electricity so to get the issue resolved I wanted to recite sankat mochan to tackle the sankat that is prevailing in Maharashtra." #NavneentRana #RanasOnChalisa #EnglishNews Times Now - Times Now News channel examines news with in-depth analysis.

Inflation has spiked with retail inflation at the highest since 2014. The daily budget has risen. Oil vegetables and sugar prices have gone up. The repo rate hiked. EMIs to go up on all loans after the repo rate hike.  "What's happening in Sri Lanka is a lesson for us," said Thirumavalavan, Chief VCK.  Congress MP, Shashi Tharoor said, "A country against its people can never prosper."

"Something is happening in Sri Lanka or Pakistan and the Opposition 'wish & hope' that the same happens in India because they don't have a 'reasonable' case against PM Modi", said Amit Malviya. On the other hand, Anand Ranganathan said, "There are two things that had 'destroyed' Sri Lanka. One is 'hyper-inflation' and the other is 'hyper-nationalism'. Currently, both of them do not fit into the India narrative." Watch the complete video now to know more. Times Now - Times Now News channel examines news with in-depth analysis.

It is now established that the commercial building that caught fire was situated in the Laldora area which is a residential area which allows only homes and not commercial licenses which leads to the obvious conclusion that the commercial building was an illegal establishment. Secondly, the building facility followed no fire safety measures to ensure protection from such unforeseen events. In fact, sources suggest no fire safety exits for escape or internal electrical wiring. The available fire extinguishers in the building were also significantly insufficient. Visuals from the spot showcase that people are jumping out of the windows due to a lack of proper exit plans. The list of lapses, in this case, is criminal, which led to the death of 27 innocent people who couldn't escape the fire. The building was illegally operational for 15 long years in the residential area without any sort of NoC from the fire department as well.

AIMIM leader Akbaruddin Owaisi visited the tomb of the Mughal Emperor Aurangzeb in the Khuldabad area of Aurangabad district on May 12. The AIMIM leader paid homage to the Mughal Emperor Aurangzeb. It's a lie that Aurangzeb destroyed temples: Mohammad Farhan, Spokesperson, AIMIM. Just today, the pen of a magistrate showed its might and became mightier than Aurangzeb's sword. This is exactly the fear that the Owaisi brothers have, says Gaurav Bhatia. This is all the BJP's games. What was the court's response to the Taj Mahal petition? I asked the court to go learn history. What's happening in this country? Every day there's a debate between Hindus and Muslims. Dr. Shaoib Jamai explains. Mahal's verdict came yesterday. We accept it. At the same time, when the Ayodhya verdict came, people like Owaisi and Shoaib Jamei chose to provoke. That's the difference, Gaurav Bhatia responded to Shaib Jamai. #NewsHour #AkbaruddinOwaisi #Aurangzeb Times Now - Times Now News channel examines news with in-depth analysis.

AIMIM chief Asaduddin Owaisi has questioned the verdict given by the Varanasi court on the Gyanvapi mosque. Mr. Owaisi has predicted a Babri Masjid-like situation for the Gyanvapi mosque. Meanwhile, the Muslim side of the case has appealed to the Supreme Court to interfere in the matter. "Aurangzeb actually betrayed this country and Owaisi is paying obeisance to this same tyrant. Will the Maha government spare this Owaisi? Is this the right thing to do for Maharashtra's government? If they actually want to put sedition on someone, then it has to be on people like Owasis who demean this country, "said Ram Kadam, BJP leader. "Aurangzeb was an Islamic scholar and a saint. Whatever is being said and written about Aurangzeb is just a distortion of facts. He always believed in communal harmony and universal brotherhood, "claims Khaleequr Rehman." On the other hand, Sanju Verma said, "If Aurangzeb was a hero and worked for communal harmony, then Asaduddin Owaisi was Elvis Presley." 4.6 million Hindus were killed and an equal number were converted during the 49-rule under Aurangzeb.

A 25-year-old man who died due to suicide was asked to pay the bribe to the official, but he recorded a video exposing the government and officials in the matter. "I wanted to construct a house in the PM Modi Scheme. I was told that most just get the money and don't construct the house. So I pawned some jewels to get money and put them in the basement. Overseer Maheshwaran said that you start construction and when the bill comes, I will give you the amount. He gave me cement, and for construction, I got money from loans. First, he said the bill would not be approved as you started construction before I could measure. But earlier, he only asked him to start construction. Then I had to take more loans for the construction of my house, and that loan is the reason for my death, and even he knows the reason, says Manikandan, who is the victim of the matter. Meanwhile, the victim's mother pleaded helplessly and said that her son was helpless and didn't have any options in front of him.

The new norm is being discussed to strike a balance between youth and experienced leaders. However, there is one exception in  1 family, 1 ticket policy. Congress general secretary Ajay Maken had said this policy won't be applicable to those who have worked for five years in the party. This means that if two or three members of the same family have worked for more than 5 years in that period, then they all would be eligible to contest polls on congress' symbol. This rule is to ensure that outsiders who join the party do not have an immediate chance of contesting an election.

The Samajwadi Party claims that the BJP is politicizing the matter. The judgement from the municipal court was a defeat for the mosque management committee, which had demanded that the surveyor be replaced. The court decided not to replace the government-appointed advocate commissioner, but it did order the recruitment of two additional lawyers to help him and his team.

In the court-mandated survey, the mosque management committee had sought for the appointment of another official as the court commissioner, accusing Mishra of favoring Hindu petitioners. The Varanasi district court had earlier ordered videography and survey of the mosque while ruling on a petition by Delhi women Rakhi Singh, Laxmi Devi, Sita Sahu and others who had pleaded the court to allow daily worship of deities Shringar Gauri, Lord Ganesha, Lord Hanuman and Nandi, whose idols are located on the outer wall of the Gyanvapi mosque. However, the survey was never done so far. But, now the court has asked for the survey report by the 17th of May and the survey is expected to begin from tomorrow onwards. A district court here on Thursday rejected the plea to change the court-appointed advocate commissioner for conducting a video survey of the Gyanvapi-Shringar Gauri complex and appointed two additional advocate commissioners to assist him. Centre welcomes judgement, the mosque committee said it intends to approach higher courts.
