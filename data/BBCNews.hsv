How China's silenced feminist Sophia Huang Xueqin went missing - BBC News\#\24,883 views\#\2022-05-18\#\bbc, bbc news, news\#\Sophia Huang Xueqin, a high-profile feminist journalist who kick-started China’s #MeToo movement, went missing in 2021.  She was awarded a prestigious Chevening scholarship in the summer earlier that year, funded by the British government to pursue gender studies at the University of Sussex.   But in September, on the way to the airport to catch her flight to the UK, Sophia and fellow activist Wang Jianbing “vanished.”  Sophia and Jianbing are among tens of thousands in China being rounded up and detained in a wider state crackdown on activists in recent years.  The two are expected to face trial for “inciting subversion of state power”.   Please subscribe HERE http://bit.ly/1rbfUog  #China #BBCNews
Afghanistan’s secret girls school defying the Taliban - BBC News\#\13,541 views\#\2022-05-18\#\bbc, bbc news, news\#\Hidden away in a residential neighbourhood is one of Afghanistan's new "secret" schools. A small but powerful act of defiance against the Taliban.  "We do our best to do this secretly," said the female teacher, "but even if they arrest me, they beat me, it's worth it."  In all but a handful of provinces in the country, girls' secondary schools have been ordered to remain closed by the Taliban.  "We know about the threats and we worry about them," the sole teacher told BBC, adding that girls' education is worth "any risk".

The bitter fight over abortion clinic protests - BBC Newsnight\#\15,585 views\#\2022-05-18\#\bbc, bbc news, news\#\Newsnight’s Anna Collinson investigates the battle to introduce buffer zones around UK abortion clinics. Please subscribe HERE http://bit.ly/1rbfUog    It is more than four years since the UK's first so-called buffer zone was set up outside an abortion clinic in the London borough of Ealing.  The aim was to prevent anti-abortion campaigners approaching - and often upsetting - patients.  Pro-choice campaigners had hoped buffer zones - which are legally-protected spaces - would soon become the norm.  But since 2018, only two more have been created in England, and BBC Newsnight has been told women are being regularly "harassed".  Anti-abortion groups deny their gatherings target women, and some say that instead they are prayer vigils meant to offer help and support.  They say that rolling out buffer zones would "criminalise prayer".   However, patients say gatherings can make them feel "fear", "distress" or "shame".  Pro-choice campaigners say the current requirement for evidence to support the establishment of a buffer zone is too demanding.  They point to an example in Bournemouth where hundreds of pieces of evidence said to demonstrate the negative impact gatherings have had outside the local clinic were submitted to the council. These included statements from women with learning difficulties, teenagers and rape victims. A buffer zone has not been enforced.  This film was produced by Louis Harris-White.  #Newsnight #BBCNews #BBC Newsnight is the BBC's flagship news and current affairs TV programme - with analysis, debate, exclusives, and robust interviews.

Afghanistan pupils in fear after Islamic State attacks - BBC News\#\48,947 views\#\2022-05-13\#\bbc, bbc news, news\#\Last month Afghanistan saw more attacks carried out by the Islamic State group targeting civilians than at any time since the Taliban takeover in August 2021.  Around 100 civilians, largely from religious minorities, were killed in a series of bombings on mosques, minibuses and a school.  15-year-old Milad was in class when an explosion struck his school in Kabul last month. Milad escaped injury, but his father was killed by a second explosion as he rushed to the scene of the initial blast.  The school reopened shortly after the explosion, but some pupils are yet to return, their families too scared of possible future attacks.

Supermassive black hole in Milky Way pictured for first time - BBC News\#\340,680 views\#\2022-05-13\#\bbc, bbc news, news, Black hole, galaxy, milky way, astronomy\#\A supermassive black hole that lives at the centre of our galaxy, the Milky Way, has been pictured for the very first time.

How Brazil's populist president Jair Bolsonaro is losing his evangelical supporters - BBC News\#\23,853 views\#\2022-05-12\#\bbc, bbc news, news\#\Brazil's far-right president Jair Bolsonaro was elected four years ago, with major support specifically from black evangelical Christian women.  "He is not the type of politician who should govern a country... because he's disrespectful," said Tatiana Gonzaga, one young evangelical Brazilian who is leading a movement against Bolsonaro on TikTok.  This October Bolsonaro will run for re-election against the left-wing former president Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva.  In 2018, nearly 70% of evangelical Christians voted for Bolsonaro, nicknamed "the Trump of the Tropics" - but this year that support looks like it might be waning.
