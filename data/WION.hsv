Speaking to our diplomatic correspondent Sidhant Sibal from Warsaw, Minister Przydacz, "India is one of the most important actors in the international scene, the biggest democracy". On Poland hosting Ukrainian refugees, minister pointed, "Poland as the neighboring country need to be ready to host possible refugees. As always, we are ready to help those who are in need but hopefully it won't happen." Poland shares border with Ukraine and also Russian territory of Kaliningrad. On Taiwan he said, while his country "sticks to one china policy" at "economical level, we are ready to cooperate with Taipei".  #Poland #MarcinPrzydacz #UkraineRussiaCrisis   About Channel:   WION -The World is One News, examines global issues with in-depth analysis.
