What was supposed to be a fun experience turned into a nightmare as a young man, on a trek with his friends, has got trapped & stranded on a sheer vertical face of an isolated canyon Malampuzha area in Kerala's Palakkad district. The man named Babu had set out to climb the Cherad hill with two others who gave up the climb after halfway. Reportedly, it has been 24 hours since the man is stuck and visuals from a drone show him sitting in what seems to be a precarious point on the cliff. The locals said that Babu had reached the top of the hill but fell and got trapped between rocks after slipping.

Hijab Row: Karnataka Edu Min Alleges 'Young Girls Instigated, Some Power Is Behind Them'\#\5,907 views\#\2022-02-11\#\Republic TV, English News, Latest English News, English News Today, Breaking News, News Today\#\#HijabRow #Karnataka #RepublicTV  Amid the ongoing hijab row in the state, Karnataka Education Minister BC Nagesh on Friday alleged the presence of a certain 'power' behind the girls who had approached the HC backed by senior lawyers and international media coverage.  Speaking to Republic TV, the Minister revealed that every student was coming without a hijab till last year, however, suddenly from December 2021, a few students started wearing it. Nagesh alleged that the young girls had been 'radicalized' and given that senior leaders such as Kapil Sibal were backing them, it was 'easily understood' that someone was behind this.   "There is clearly some hand behind these girls. We have said it a 100 times that the management has the right to insist on the uniform. Girls were coming without hijab; they were following the uniform, but they started hijab from December 2021, and hence they were not entertained. Till now, 5000-6000 have passed the college and only 6 girls have a problem. Someone has instigated and radicalized the girls," said Nagesh.

As TMC Checks I-Pac's Influence, Prashant Kishor's Firm Unfollows Mamata Banerjee On Twitter\#\15,020 views\#\2022-02-11\#\Republic TV, English News, Latest English News, English News Today, Breaking News, News Today\#\#IPAC #PrashantKishor #MamataBanerjee #RepublicTV  The Indian Political Action Committee (I-PAC) has stopped following West Bengal Chief Minister Mamata Banerjee and the Trinamool Congress on Twitter. This development comes after reports suggested sour relations between Prashant Kishor-led I-PAC and the Trinamool Congress chief. Interestingly, the political advocacy group continues to follow Mamata's nephew Abhishek Banerjee, and also other top politicians that Prashant Kishor has worked with.  After unfollowing Mamata Banerjee on Twitter, I-PAC informed that it doesn't hand any digital properties or any of its leaders.  "Anyone making such claim is either uninformed or is blatantly lying," it added.  Taking a dig at TMC, the political consultancy firm said that the party should look into if and "how their digital properties and/or that of their leaders are being “allegedly (mis)used”."

The specialised unit of commandos was deployed after 11 Pakistani boats were seized in the border state.  According to a BSF officer, after eight Pakistani boats were spotted during routine aerial surveillance of the Harami Nala area through drones on Wednesday, intruders sensed the situation and jumped off from their boats to escape. DIG BSF, Bhuj, immediately launched a massive search operation in the area spread over almost 300 square kilometres. On Thursday, three more boats were nabbed.  A team has been sent through fast attack crafts to detain suspected persons, in an operation that has lasted more than 30 hours. "They are still hiding in the area because the entire area is under the strict watch of BSF since then," a senior BSF officer told ANI.

The funds had been raised for three separate campaigns for the purpose of COVID relief.

'Hijab Row Part Of Plot To Disturb Peace': RSS' Indresh Kumar Slams 'Misuse Of Children'\#\4,265 views\#\2022-02-13\#\Republic TV, English News, Latest English News, English News Today, Breaking News, News Today\#\#IndreshKumar #HijabRow #RepublicTV  Amid the spiralling hijab controversy in the country, RSS leader Indresh Kumar on Thursday condemned the “hidden vote bank politics”, and the “misuse” of school-going children into issues that disturb peace and harmony in the country.  Speaking to Republic, Indresh Kumar said, There's no city in India where Muslim children do not go to school. So many of them go to school without Hijab. Muskan Khan Bibi also went to college without Hijab. Some hardliners have misused her to shame India and malign the name of Islam. I caution the daughters to beware of such people.”   Muskan Khan is the student whose video of being heckled by a group of miscreants went viral during hijab protests in Karnataka.   The senior RSS leader stated that the Hijab row had been raked up by conspirators who want to disturb the peace, harmony, unity, and development of the state. Slamming the political parties who were fuelling the issue, Kumar said such people are dangerous to society.

Ukraine Crisis: UK PM Boris Johnson Hints On Sanctions Against Russia, Solution Through Diplomacy\#\2,642 views\#\2022-02-15\#\Republic TV, English News, Latest English News, English News Today, Breaking News, News Today\#\Ukraine Crisis: UK PM Boris Johnson Hints On Sanctions Against Russia, Solution Through Diplomacy  #BorisJohnson #Ukraine #RepublicTV  After Russia announced that it will be withdrawing some of its troops from the Ukrainian border, UK Prime Minister Boris Johnson stated that he is getting mixed signals from Russia's assertion. As per a report by ITV News, Russia's statement is being viewed with a lot of scepticism by the West. The British Prime Minister acknowledged the "signs of a diplomatic opening" after Western nations agreed to scare Russia with a package of sanctions aimed at Russian money.  Johnson commented after a meeting of the Cobra emergency committee that the information that they seeing today is still not encouraging, with Russian field hospitals being established near Belarus' Ukrainian border. He stated that this could only be construed as invasion preparation, according to ITV News. Despite Russian claims that troops are being withdrawn, Johnson said intelligence indicated that additional battalion tactical groups are being brought closer to the border.

Speaking exclusively to Republic Media Network's Executive Editor Niranjan Narayanaswamy, the AIMIM spokesperson affirmed that he cannot be arrested or detained simply for seeking to participate in a peaceful protest in solidarity with the Muslim students being barred from entering colleges in Karnataka for wearing Hijab. Dubbing his detention the "murder of democracy", Pathan opined that the authorities are trying to suppress his voice.  Waris Pathan remarked, "This is murder of democracy, this is murder of Constitution. I was to attend a peaceful protest. It was arranged by AIMIM national women's wing in Mumbai. I was supposed to go there, it was a peaceful protest. They are not allowing me to go. Since morning, police came into my residence, was put under house arrest and then brought to the Worli Police Station."  Daring the MVA to reveal its stance on the Hijab row, he said, "I want to question the Muslim leaders of Maharashtra. What is their view on this? Do they accept that I have been arrested and detained merely for attending a peaceful protest to show solidarity with our sisters who are not being allowed to attend colleges in Karnataka for wearing hijab"? Weighing in on the need to protest in Mumbai when the issue is limited to Karnataka, the AIMIM leader added, "The Constitution is applicable all over India. The Constitution is applicable to Karnataka and the same Constitution is applicable to Maharashtra as well".

Relatives of Tapor Pullom, a resident of Shiyomi district of Arunachal Pradesh who went missing in 2015, continue to await his return. Republic Media Network on Wednesday accessed exclusive details of and accounts of Pullom's disappearance, and how he continues to remain missing more than 6 years after he was allegedly 'abducted' by the PLA.   According to Pullom's daughter-in-law Amoni Diru, Tapor Pullom left his residence on September 11, 2015, to go for hunting and herb collection. He was accompanied by a friend named Takayorthi who returned home a few days later, reluctant to divulge any information about Pullom's whereabouts.  Upon being pressurized he revealed that Tapor Pullom has allegedly been abducted by Goring (Chinese people in local language) from Manigaon in Shiyomi which is India's last village in Arunachal Pradesh. When the family approached the District Administration in October 2015, they were allegedly turned down, with officials stating that the matter is not under their jurisdiction.

Arvind Kejriwal Condemns Punjab CM Channi's 'Bhaiyya' Remark, Says 'Priyanka Gandhi Belongs To UP'\#\7,297 views\#\2022-02-16\#\Republic TV, English News, Latest English News, English News Today, Breaking News, News Today\#\Arvind Kejriwal Condemns Punjab CM Channi's 'Bhaiyya' Remark, says 'Priyanka Gandhi belongs to UP'   #ArvindKejriwal #CharanjitSinghChanni #RepublicTV  With 4 days left for the polls, Punjab CM Charanjit Singh Channi stirred a row by exhorting people to not let "Bhaiyas" from Uttar Pradesh, Bihar and Delhi enter the state. Addressing a gathering alongside Congress general secretary Priyanka Gandhi Vadra, he was heard saying, "Priyanka Gandhi is Punjaban. She is the daughter-in-law of Punjab. 'Bhaiyas' from UP, Bihar and Delhi want to come and rule Punjab. We will not let them win." Vadra too came in for criticism for not objecting to the disparaging remark about 'Bhaiyas' despite hailing from UP, which too is witnessing elections at present.   Responding to this, AAP supremo Arvind Kejriwal remarked, "This is a very shameful statement. Our entire country is one. They keep calling me 'black'. We strongly condemn such a comment about any person or community. Priyanka Gandhi belongs to UP, so she is a Bhaiya too."

Russia's Foreign Ministry Releases Response To US On Security Guarantees In Eastern Europe\#\2,816 views\#\2022-02-17\#\Republic TV, English News, Latest English News, English News Today, Breaking News, News Today\#\#Russia #US #RepublicTV  Amid ongoing tensions along the Ukrainian border, the Russian Foreign Ministry on Thursday released its response to the United States on the security guarantee proposals in Eastern Europe. The Ministry clearly said in the statement that calls to withdraw Russian troops from certain areas of the country are "extremely unreasonable". The Ministry highlighted that Moscow is concerned about the United States' and NATO's increasing military activities near Russian borders, while the country's 'red lines' and vital security interests, as well as its sovereign right to protect them, continue to be ignored.   "Ultimatum-like demands for the withdrawal of soldiers from specific places on Russian soil, accompanied by threats of tougher sanctions, are unacceptable and jeopardise the chances of striking real agreements," the ministry said in its response, Sputnik reported. The ministry also stated that Russia has no plans to invade Ukraine, which is why statements blaming Moscow for the escalation can only be interpreted as an attempt to impose pressure and devalue Russia's security guarantees. During a telephonic conversation with his Russian counterpart, Sergei Lavrov, on February 15, US Secretary of State Antony Blinken had said that the US is looking forward to receiving a written response from Russia in response to the security demands presented to Washington and NATO last December.

The row was triggered after he suggested that the saffron flag could replace India's tricolour in the future and that it would be unfurled at the Red Fort one day. Congress has taken strong exception to the BJP Minister's comments and launched back-to-back protests in the Assembly, demanding his resignation. Leader of Opposition Siddaramaiah even called for sedition charges to be slapped against Eshwarappa.

Thirdly, he must also mention in the affidavit whether he tried to withdraw cases against terrorists in 2013 or not. The country knows their true colours.

I think he deserved honesty and clarity," Dravid replied in his typical classy manner where he revealed little about a breach of trust with regards to dressing room conversation.

These sanctions came hours after Germany halted Russia's lucrative Nord Stream 2 gas pipeline that was to help meet Europe's energy needs.  Asserting that Russia's invasion has begun, Biden warned that sanctions would also escalate if the invasion does. He made clear that America doesn't intend to fight Russia militarily but will defend every inch of NATO territory. Accordingly, Biden announced that the US would continue defensively supporting Ukraine, will reinforce NATO and will move its Europe-based troops to strengthen its Baltic allies.   Excoriating his Russian counterpart whom he's earlier called 'a a killer', Biden warned that Putin would launch a bigger assault and called his demands 'extreme'. He, however, left the door open to resolving the crisis via diplomacy  Subscribe to Republic TV & press THE BELL ICON to be updated with the latest news ► http://bit.ly/RepublicWorld Official Website - https://www.republicworld.com/  Republic TV is India's no.1 English news channel since its launch.

On Thursday, Russian troops launched their anticipated onslaught on Ukraine, with President Vladimir Putin warning that any attempt to intervene would result in "consequences you have never seen in the history."  In Kyiv, Kharkiv, and Odessa, large explosions were heard before daybreak. President Volodymyr Zelensky of Ukraine has proclaimed martial law, claiming that Russia has targeted Ukraine's military infrastructure. China, unlike the United States, "wouldn't provide weapons to other sides when we see a risk of conflict," Foreign Ministry spokesperson Hua Chunying said during a regular media briefing in Beijing.  "I think Russia, as a capable major power, does not need such support from China or others," Hua continued.

The resolution that would have asked Russia to withdraw all troops from Ukraine gained 11 votes to 1 against as Russia vetoed it. China, India and the United Arab Emirates abstained from the vote. The UNSC resolution came up to vote after Russia launched a full-fledged military attack on Ukraine, killing at least 137 civilians and military personnel on the first day.  The draft resolution vetoed by Russia is being looked at as a win by Western countries as it showed Russia's international isolation. The United Arab Emirates and India abstained from the vote on the US-drafted resolution while the remaining 11 council members voted in favour of the same. The US and other supporters of the resolution knew it wouldn't pass as Russia was clear to veto it at the UNSC. However, those in favour argued that the vote highlighted Russia's international isolation.

When Zelensky was asked about US President Joe Biden's administration’s offer of evacuating Kyiv, the Ukrainian President said, "The fight is here; I need ammunition, not a ride," according to a senior American intelligence official with direct knowledge of the conversation, stated AP.  Earlier in an address to the nation on Friday night, Zelensky outlined the situation for the country. He had said, “This night will be very difficult, and the enemy will use all available forces to break the resistance of Ukrainians” adding that “the fate of Ukraine is being decided right now." It is pertinent to note that most of the West has refused to send troops inside Ukraine and instead deployed troops in European nations.  Zelensky even accused Russians of attacking kindergartens and civilian structures. He said, "There is nothing that could possibly explain why the kindergartens and civilian infrastructure are being shelled." Pledging to remain in Kyiv, Ukrainian President also said: “Our main goal is to finish this slaughter. The enemy losses are very grave — today there were hundreds of killed soldiers who crossed our border and came on our land…Unfortunately, we also suffer losses."

The group includes high-ranking officials from foreign, defence ministries and Russian President Vladimir Putin's office. The delegation is currently waiting in the Belarusian city of Gomel and "now waiting for the Ukrainians." Peskov said, as quoted by the Associated Press.  However, Ukrainian president Volodymyr Zelensky, who had initially proposed diplomatic talks with Russia before the latter unleashed "unprovoked" war on its neighbour, refused to sit for talks with Moscow after Russian forces killed over 100 civilians and military personnel in Ukraine on the first day of attacks.  The developments come as Putin on Friday asserted that he is ready to send his representatives to Belarus for talks with Kyiv provided Ukraine "laid down its weapons". Belarusian President Alexander Lukashenko, which is a strong ally of Moscow had then promised Peskov that he would "create the conditions" for such a summit to take place.

Russia-Ukraine War: BJP's Vijayvargiya Backs Centre's Stance; 'Kyiv Never Supported India'\#\57,100 views\#\2022-02-28\#\Republic TV, English News, Latest English News, English News Today, Breaking News, News Today\#\#Russia #Ukraine #RussiaUkraineWar #RepublicTV  Amid disappointment in some quarters over India's reluctance to condemn Russia for attacking Ukraine, BJP national General Secretary Kailash Vijayvargiya backed the Centre's stance. He contended that Ukraine would not have adopted an antagonist position vis-à-vis Russia if it was not egged on by the US and NATO.  Lauding India's stance on the ongoing war, he stressed that war is not a solution for any problem. In a veiled justification of India abstaining from voting on two recent resolutions at the United Nations Security Council, the BJP leader highlighted that Ukraine had never supported India on the global forums.   Speaking to the media on Sunday, Kailash Vijayvargiya opined, "From the beginning, it is our belief that a war is not a solution to any problem. A problem is solved by dialogue. When the war happened, PM talked to Putin and reportedly said that war is not a solution to the problem and pressed for a dialogue. I do not know what Putin said in response."

"Offensive in Ukraine resumes after ceasefire", Russia's state-affiliated media RT announced.   A seven-hour long ceasefire began in Mariupol and Volnovakha cities of Ukraine on Saturday in order to set up humanitarian corridors for the evacuation of civilians and delivery of food and medicines. Mariupol with a population of 440,000 people and Volnovakha with 21,000 had been largely cut off water, heat, and electricity amid the war, Ukrainian media reported. Given the humanitarian crisis, a 64-km long Mariupol- Nikolskoe - Rozovka - Pologi - Orekhov - Zaporozhye route was chosen as a corridor and citizens of these crisis-hit cities were allowed to leave and seek aid. Announcing the establishment of the corridor, Russia stated that the area had been demilitarised and won’t suffer shelling anymore.
