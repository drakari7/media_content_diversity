They observe that the Nifty IT index is down 11% (vs 1% decline in broader Nifty Index) and its PE has de-rated to +1SD from +2SD of its three-year average. JP Morgan has realigned their target multiples to bake in a rise of the cost of capital. This has resulted in a 10-15% price target cuts for all their coverage stocks. They reason that TCS has outperformed peers, limiting further potential upside and have downgraded the counter from Overweight to Neutral. On Mindtree, they believe that the recent underperformance vs. the sector YTD brings it close to fair value, driving upgrade to Neutral from Underweight.  #CNBCTV18 #BusinessNews #ShareMarketToday #Nifty #Sensex  CNBC-TV18 is India's No.1 Business medium and the undisputed leader in business news.

But the Czech brand's image in India has largely been built on the back of its sedans, starting with the Octavia over 20 years ago, and then complemented by the Superb and Rapid at either end. So with the Rapid being around as long as it has been, a contemporary Skoda sedan that is easily accessible has been a glaring blank space in the lineup. This is the gap the Skoda Slavia plugs, and to go a step further, will revitalize the sedan market, as Skoda claims.   #BusinessNews #BusinessNewsToday #BusinessNewsInEnglish #ShareMarketToday  About CNBC-TV18: India's leading business news channel, CNBC-TV18 offers the most comprehensive coverage of businesses, the economy and the financial markets.

But with competition in the segment constantly intensifying, Jeep India has now expanded the Compass line-up by reintroducing the top-spec Traihawk in its facelifted form. The Trailhawk badge is reserved for the most capable of Jeep's offerings. SUVs with the 'Trail Rated' badge are put through a more rigorous set of tests to further improve off-roading capability. So the facelifted Compass Trailhwak continues with the same set of enhancements over the standard Compass as earlier but, manoeuvrability in the rough has improved further.   #BusinessNews #BusinessNewsToday #BusinessNewsInEnglish #ShareMarketToday  About CNBC-TV18: India's leading business news channel, CNBC-TV18 offers the most comprehensive coverage of businesses, the economy and the financial markets.
