Hardik Patel Quits Congress LIVE News | Big Blow To Gujarat Congress Ahead Of Elections\#\18,872 views\#\2022-05-18\#\india today, india today news, india today live, indian news live, india news live, english news, english news live\#\Hardik Patel has quit the Congress, in a huge blow to the party just months before the Gujarat election. In a long resignation letter to Congress president Sonia Gandhi, he took aim at Rahul Gandhi, saying, "Our leader was abroad when he was needed in India during critical times." Days after Rahul Gandhi's Gujarat visit, when a meeting between the two did not materialize, Hardik Patel also wrote, without naming anyone: "When I met top leaders, they seemed distracted by their mobile phones and other issues as opposed to listening to issues concerning Gujarat."  The Congress leadership "strongly dislikes Gujarat and has no interest in the state", he said, adding that the Congress "has been rejected in virtually every state because they have no roadmap to present to the people."  The Patidar activist joined the Congress in 2019, just before the Lok Sabha election. He was made the Working President of the Congress in Gujarat, a post that he said had meant little in his years in the party.  "I am gathering the courage to resign from the Congress party and post. I am sure my decision will be welcomed by my colleagues and the people of Gujarat. I believe that with this step, I will be able to work positively for Gujarat in future," Hardik Patel wrote in a Twitter post sharing his resignation letter.  #HardikPatel #HardikPatelQuitsCongress #IndiaToday  Subscribe to India Today for NEW VIDEOS EVERY DAY and make sure to enable Push Notifications so you'll never miss a new video.

The actress developed complications as fluid began to accumulate in her lungs. She then breathed her last despite attempts to save her. Her parents accused the doctors of negligence and have lodged a complaint. Chethana Raj was known for her daily soaps such as Geetha and Doresani. On May 16, she decided to get 'fat-free' plastic surgery at Shetty's Cosmetic Centre in Rajajinagar in Bengaluru.  However, the surgery did not go as planned. Anesthetist Melvin along with the doctors who performed the plastic surgery brought Chethana to Kaade Hospital at 5.30 pm and threatened the doctors to treat her as a person who had suffered a cardiac arrest. Doctors at the Kaade hospital initiated CPR and despite trying for 45 minutes, Chethana could not be revived. ICU Intensivist Dr Sandeep, in his complaint to the police inspector of Basaveshwaranagar station, had mentioned that Chethana was declared dead at 6.45 pm.  #ChethanaRaj #PlasticSurgey #KannadaactressChethanaRaj #IndiaToday  Subscribe to India Today for NEW VIDEOS EVERY DAY and make sure to enable Push Notifications so you'll never miss a new video.

B. Hedgewar, RSS founder K.B Hedgewar, karnataka textbook politics latest news updates, karnataka textbook politics showdown latest news updates, india today latest news updates, india today news updates, india today\#\Amid allegations in some quarters that a lesson on freedom fighter Bhagat Singh was omitted, the Karnataka Textbook Society on Tuesday clarified that the chapter has not been removed, and the Kannada textbook of Class 10 is currently at the printing stage.  Organisations like All-India Democratic Students Organisation, AIDSO and the All-India Save Education Committee, AISEC had alleged that a speech by RSS founder Keshav Baliram Hedgewar was included in the textbook, while omitting a lesson on Bhagat Singh.  "Currently there are reports in the media that a lesson on Hedgewar has been included into class 10 first language Kannada text book by omitting a chapter on Bhagat Singh. The reality is that the chapter on Bhagat Singh has not been omitted from textbooks," the society said in a statement.  Primary and Secondary Education Minister B C Nagesh on Monday defended inclusion of a speech by Hedgewar in a revised Kannada textbook.  He had said that the textbook does not contain anything about Hedgewar or RSS, but only his speech on what should be an inspiration to people, especially the youth, and that those who have raised objections have not gone through the textbook.  The organisations have also alleged that works by renaissance literary figures like A N Murthi Rao's 'Vyaghrageethe,' P Lankesh's 'Mruga Mattu Sundari,' and Sara Aboobacker's 'Yuddha' were omitted from the textbook.  #KarnatakaTextbookPolitics #BhagatSingh #Hedgewar #IndiaToday   Subscribe to India Today for NEW VIDEOS EVERY DAY and make sure to enable Push Notifications so you'll never miss a new video.

In a long resignation letter to Congress president Sonia Gandhi, he took aim at Rahul Gandhi, saying, "Our leader was abroad when he was needed in India during critical times." Days after Rahul Gandhi's Gujarat visit, when a meeting between the two did not materialize, Hardik Patel also wrote, without naming anyone: "When I met top leaders, they seemed distracted by their mobile phones and other issues as opposed to listening to issues concerning Gujarat."  The Congress leadership "strongly dislikes Gujarat and has no interest in the state", he said, adding that the Congress "has been rejected in virtually every state because they have no roadmap to present to the people."  The Patidar activist joined the Congress in 2019, just before the Lok Sabha election. He was made the Working President of the Congress in Gujarat, a post that he said had meant little in his years in the party.  "I am gathering the courage to resign from the Congress party and post. I am sure my decision will be welcomed by my colleagues and the people of Gujarat. I believe that with this step, I will be able to work positively for Gujarat in future," Hardik Patel wrote in a Twitter post sharing his resignation letter.  #HardikPatel #HardikPatelQuitsCongress #IndiaToday  Subscribe to India Today for NEW VIDEOS EVERY DAY and make sure to enable Push Notifications so you'll never miss a new video.

The video of the boy singing a patriotic song for Modi during the Prime Minister’s trip to Germany earlier this month was tweeted by Kamra after replacing the song that the child sang, Janmabhoomi Bharat, with a Bollywood song about price rise — Mehengayi daayan khaaye jaat hain.  On May 5, NCPCR had sought action against Kamra for tweeting the video. “A letter in this regard was sent to your good offices… calling for an ATR (action taken report) in the instant complaint within seven days or receipt of the letter. However, no such ATR has been yet received by the commission,” the NCPCR said in a letter sent to Twitter India on Tuesday.  #KunalKamraTweet #KunalKamraTweetControversy #IndiaToday  Subscribe to India Today for NEW VIDEOS EVERY DAY and make sure to enable Push Notifications so you'll never miss a new video.

On Monday, the court ordered to seal the area of the mosque after a lawyer claimed about a 'shivling' being found in the pond of the Kashi Vishwanath-Gyanvapi complex during survey of the premises.  The mosque’s management committee - Anjuman-e-Intezamia - had moved the Supreme Court last week seeking a stay on the survey as well as on the proceedings at the Varanasi civil court.  While the survey and videography proceedings have been completed, the Muslim side is hopeful of a favourable order - a stay on the proceedings and not make the survey and its report public.  The plea argued that the fresh suits filed in 2021 citing the “right to Worship” were “barred by the 1991 Places of Worship Act” and were an attempt to revive the dispute which had been put to rest by this law.  #GyanvapiMosqueSurvey #GyanvapiMosqueDispute #GyanvapiMosqueVerdict #IndiaToday   Subscribe to India Today for NEW VIDEOS EVERY DAY and make sure to enable Push Notifications so you'll never miss a new video.

The "Shivling" (symbol of Lord Shiva) was said to be found this morning, on the last day of the court-mandated filming of the mosque complex following a petition seeking access to pray at a shrine behind the mosque.  Water was drained from the pond and a "Shivling" was found, claimed Subhash Nandan Chaturvedi, the lawyer representing a group of Hindu women who have sought year-long access to pray at the shrine. Some of the petitioners reportedly exclaimed "Baba Mil Gaye" at the court ruling.  The pond, used for "Wazoo" or purification rituals before namaaz, must be sealed, the petitioners requested the court. The court accepted the plea and ordered the Varanasi District Magistrate to ensure that the pond was closed to the public. The court also said the administration, police and security personnel must make sure no one entered the sealed area.  Muslim petitioners rejected the assertion, claiming it was a "fountain, not a shivling".  #GyanvapiMosqueSurvey #GyanvapiMosqueVideographySurvey #GyanvapiMosqueDispute #IndiaToday  Subscribe to India Today for NEW VIDEOS EVERY DAY and make sure to enable Push Notifications so you'll never miss a new video.

Attacking Uddhav Thackeray over the Hanuman Chalisa row, Devendra Fadnavis said, “Would Balasaheb Thackeray ever have thought that reciting the Hanuman Chalisa would be a crime under his son’s rule while visiting the tomb of Aurangzeb would be ignored?”  Taking his attack on Uddhav Thackeray further, Fadnavis emphasised that he was not born with a silver spoon in his mouth.  “I have done politics on ground, not five-star politics... Only when the king comes out of his palace will he understand the pain of poor people.

Modi will have a comprehensive agenda to expand cooperation in multiple areas, including hydropower and connectivity, Foreign Secretary Vinay Mohan Kwatra said on Friday. Asked whether the boundary dispute between the two sides will figure in the talks, he said that India has always maintained that the existing bilateral mechanisms are the best way forward to deliberate on the issues, adding they should be discussed in a “responsible manner" without “politicisation".  The foreign secretary said Modi and Deuba will build on their productive conversation in Delhi last month. He said the visit will “reaffirm" India’s commitment to ties with Nepal and demonstrate the priority that New Delhi attaches to the neighbourhood.  Meanwhile, a day ahead of his visit, Modi said he was looking forward to meeting Deuba after their “productive" discussions during the latter’s visit to India last month.  #NaMosteNepal #PMModiInNepal #IndiaNepalBilateralTies #IndiaToday  Subscribe to India Today for NEW VIDEOS EVERY DAY and make sure to enable Push Notifications so you'll never miss a new video.

The idea is part of the party’s attempt to give it a “young look.”  The panel, led by Sonia Gandhi, will discuss the party's plan for strengthening and revitalising the organisation. It is intended to produce a strategy for commencing structural reforms inside the organisation, issue the Udaipur declaration, which will be executed in a timely way, and begin preparations for the 2024 Lok Sabha elections.  #CongressKeyMeet #CongressChintanShivirMeet #SoniaGandhi #RahulGandhi #IndiaToday   Subscribe to India Today for NEW VIDEOS EVERY DAY and make sure to enable Push Notifications so you'll never miss a new video.

She wrote on the micro-blogging website: “So the ‘office’ has circulated these messages among the (sic) congress leaders & volunteers asking them troll me. Save yourself the trouble- I’ll do it myself.”  The former MP had tweeted in response to the news that Karnataka Pradesh Congress Committee President D K Shivakumar had alleged Karnataka's Higher Education Minister Dr C N Ashwath Narayan to have met party strongman M B Patil seeking protection amid investigation into the police sub-inspector (PSI) recruitment scam.  However, both Patil and Ashwath Narayan rubbished the charge saying there was no truth to it, while some Congress leaders expressed that D K Shivkumar should not have made such a statement casting aspersions on his own senior colleague.  This also led Divya Spandana tweeted that, “People across parties meet each other, go to functions, some even get married into families - I’m surprised @DKShivakumar would say this about @MBPatil who’s a staunch congressman. Shouldn’t the party be fighting elections as one unit? @INCIndia.”  #KarnatakaCongressImplosion #DKShivakumar #AshwathNarayan #MBPatil #IndiaToday  Subscribe to India Today for NEW VIDEOS EVERY DAY and make sure to enable Push Notifications so you'll never miss a new video.
