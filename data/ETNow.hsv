Musk told a Miami technology conference that a viable deal at a lower price would not be out of the question. At the 'All In Summit', Musk estimated that at least 20% of Twitter's 229 million accounts are spam bots.  The statement came a few hours after Musk trolled Twitter CEO Parag Agrawal, who posted a series of tweets explaining his company's effort to fight bots and how it has consistently estimated that less than 5% of Twitter accounts are fake. In a fresh twist, Musk also stated that he will not go ahead with the deal unless assured that less than 5% accounts are fake. Will there be a climbdown from Musk's $44 billion offer? What's in store for the microblogging platform after the potential takeover?

This led to an increase in exports from India in spite of production being lower. This mismatch in supply and demand forced the central government to prohibit the exports of wheat with immediate effect on the 14th of May. Meanwhile, wheat prices touched record high levels in the international markets. The surge in prices also comes on the back of the heatwave impact on the crop which is driving up domestic prices. Was a ban on wheat exports the only option for India? What will the global implications of the ban be?

Cost pressures have dented margins and bottomline this quarter. Consolidated sales have come in at Rs 1940 cr (+27% YoY)  due to lower than expected RAC volumes. Operating Margins have come in at 6.5%( down 236bps YoY) due to cost pressures and adverse product mix. Profit after tax for the quarter stood at Rs57.2 cr ( down 24% YoY). RAC volumes missed management’s FY22 guidance of 3 mn units. Management attributed the weak volumes to supply-chain challenges faced by brands. However, interestingly, in Q4 commentary, other players said there were no supply-chain issues in the quarter and that they do not foresee any potential problems until Jun-Jul’22. On the demand front, company witnessed robust demand due to normal, yet intense summers. B2B business has also revived in the last few months. As far as headwinds are concerned, Geo political tensions have led to inflationary pressure. Surge in input costs get passed-on to customers with a lag of about 30 days. Covid-led lockdowns in China has resulted in supply-chain constraints and shortages of components. Management expects RAC industry volumes to grow at 30%+ in FY23 and Amber to grow above that. The focus of the company now is on improving the revenue market share in RACs, which stands at 26.5% currently.

The first major hike was done in March 2022. Few major tweaks in pricing were always done at prices, but this is for the second time, that a blanket hike has taken place in prices across the 20-major routes in India. For 7-day forward booking, the prices have been hiked by around 8%-11%. For 2-month forward booking, the prices have been hiked by around 11%-17%. The biggest reason behind this hike is the rise in fuel prices. Year-to-date, Brent Crude has surged 41%, while jet fuel prices have increased by 58%. The hike in ticket prices bodes well for the airlines as the same means that they can pass on the increased fuel prices to consumers. However, it will be important to watch how consumers react to the price hike and how the demand shapes up.
