They observe that the Nifty IT index is down 11% (vs 1% decline in broader Nifty Index) and its PE has de-rated to +1SD from +2SD of its three-year average. JP Morgan has realigned their target multiples to bake in a rise of the cost of capital. This has resulted in a 10-15% price target cuts for all their coverage stocks. They reason that TCS has outperformed peers, limiting further potential upside and have downgraded the counter from Overweight to Neutral. On Mindtree, they believe that the recent underperformance vs. the sector YTD brings it close to fair value,  driving upgrade to Neutral from Underweight. However, they remain constructive on the sector with Overweights on Infosys, Tech Mahindra and Mphasis.

The Govt has received a good response for the PLI Scheme so far. 72 companies have registered while 46 have submitted the draft application for the PLI Scheme for the Textile sector. The last date for submission of the application is 14th Feb. He hopes that funds/incentives allocated for PLI Scheme, i.e, close to Rs 10,700 crore will be fully utilized. MITRA Scheme: the Centre is in constant touch and dialogues with the States. 15th March is the last date for submission of application for the MITRA scheme. So far only Andhra Pradesh submitted the formal interest. Hope that near to deadline many more states may come forward for having one National Textile Park for their respective State. Raw Cotton or natural cotton prices are high in the market which is good for the cotton farmers. The cotton acreage which is low this year is likely to go up for next year, as farmers are getting good returns for the cotton crop. For the textile Manufacturers, govt is thinking to allow the imports of Extra Long Staple Cotton. The proposal has already been taken up with Revenue Dept. A separate HSN code to allow the imports for ELS Cotton is likely to be issued soon. Imports of ELS Cotton to provide immediate relief to the Textile industry. FTA with Canada, UAE, Australia may soon be announced. This will help the textile sector in boosting exports.

In such a backdrop, it is best to stay rightfully informed about the differences between different categories of investment. Though multi-cap and Flexi-cap funds may seem similar, there are important differences in investment mandates. Largely, the investment objective of multi-cap funds and Flexi-cap funds have always been similar as both invest in stocks across various market capitalizations. Although Multi cap fund offers a great diversification with the equity asset class, stock picking could be a challenge especially in the small-cap category, the exposure could particularly cost the performance during a market downtrend. However, Flexi-cap funds, on the other hand, are mandated to invest at least 65% of their assets in equities, there is no restriction in terms of market-cap exposure. This provides the fund managers complete freedom to align the portfolio with the preferred segment based on market trends. However, if the fund manager is unable to foresee the market trends appropriately, there could be a severe downside risk.   To discuss in-depth the same and to get an expert opinion on how you should go about splitting your equity portfolio based on the categories, depending on whether you are a beginner or a long-term player in the investment zone, we have on The Money Show, Harsh Roongta Founder of Fee-Only Investment Advisers LLP.

This is besides any cash income that the homemaker would be earning. Any homemaker should ask themselves one question: will my family have enough financial resources to maintain the same lifestyle in my absence? This is where a term insurance plan comes into the picture! Before getting term insurance for a homemaker, you might want to check on several things. It would be best if you looked at how much cover would be sufficient for the family. Consider factors that come into play, such as the expenditure habits of the family, education plans for the children, loans, and liabilities, and anything else that may need you to shell out that extra bit of cash.

Advisors often say it is the cornerstone of your finances and is much more important that choosing the right financial instruments. A big part of maintaining an asset allocation strategy is to rebalance your portfolio on a regular basis.  This involves setting rules that govern when and how a portfolio must get rebalanced. These rules help an investor to take logical decisions – adding more equity when the chips are down and booking profit when markets are booming.  What’s more, taking these decisions can help in the process of ‘tax harvesting’ – a method that makes tax planning for your investments more efficient.

This is because inflation is running rampant in several economies around the world. And while the Reserve Bank of India’s Monetary Policy Committee, in its latest review earlier this week, chose to keep policy rates and its accommodative stance unchanged, most expect at least a nominal increase in rates in 2022. The Indian central bank’s response to the Covid-19 pandemic was to dramatically reduce policy interest rates. And, as a result, home loan rates fell to a historical low. Even today, a home loan, depending on amount, tenor and house value, can cost between 6.5% and 7%. On this episode of The Money Show, ET Now speaks to Adhil Shetty, chief executive officer of Bank Bazaar and Hemant Rustagi, founder of Wiseinvest Advisors about the factors an individual should bear in mind before buying a house on loan.

RBI has informed Religare Finvest that restructuring of RFL cannot be implemented due to this classification by lenders. However, RFL has challenged the fraud classification. Ms Saluja says that they are hopeful that the fraud classification will be reversed. She added that they have done enough to disassociate themselves from the erstwhile promoters and that they have themselves been victims of fraud. She highlights that challenge is not for restructuring to happen but the challenge is why should they be denied a chance to be called victims of fraud.

According to Srivastava, investors themselves will not opt to open an account with PSU Banks, then why should they consider investing in them. “Private banks have a far superior talent pool,” he says.

CBI sources told ET Now that the agency is scrutinising all data in detail before filing cases to ensure that charges sustain in court. CBI has said that it couldn't file around 100 high-value bank fraud cases due to the withdrawal of general consent by states, which hindered the investigation. The agency has issued lookout circulars against the accused directors, promoters, and public servants to stop them from fleeing India. The accused named in CBI's FIR are Rishi Kumar Agarwal, Santhanam Muthaswamy, Ashwani Kumar, Sushil Agarwal, and Ravi Vimal Nevetia. CBI's description and timeline of ABG Shipyard case: ABG Shipyard has been in business with the SBI (State Bank of India) since 2001. The account of ABG Shipyard turned NPA on 30th November 2013 as per SBI. According to the bank's complaint, the NPA was to the tune of Rs. 22,842 crores, with a major disbursement taking place between 2005 to 2012 by a consortium of 28 banks led by ICICI Bank. Though the account was restructured under CDR mechanism on 27th March 2014, the operations of the company couldn't be revived. On 10th September 2014, N V Dand & Associates was deputed to conduct a stock audit of ABG Shipyard. The Audit Firm submitted its report on 30th April 2016, observing various faults on part of the accused company. Subsequently, the account of ABG Shipyard was declared an NPA on 30th July 2016, with effect from 30th November 2013. In line with a 2014 policy to red flag suspect accounts, commission forensic audits by empanelled forensic auditors and make CMDs liable, a forensic audit was initiated based on a decision taken in a Joint Lenders Meeting on 10th April 2018, where Ernst & Young LLP was appointed as Forensic Auditor. As per usual practice, these forensic audits cover a period starting approximately three to four years prior to the date of declaration of NPA, which in this case was 2016. Therefore, the forensic audit of ABG Shipyar covered the period from 2012 to 2017. Meanwhile, the company was also referred to NCLT, Ahmedabad on 1st August 2017 by ICICI Bank for Corporate Insolvency Resolution Process (CIRP). From April 2019 to March 2020, various banks in the consortium declared ABG Shipyard's account as fraud, which was primarily on account of the huge transfer of money to its related parties and subsequently making adjustment entries. It was also alleged that huge investment was made in the company's overseas subsidiary by diverting bank loans and funds to purchase huge assets in the name of its related parties. During the perusal of records and its initial investigation, CBI noted that the critical period was 2005 to 2012. SBI filed a complaint with CBI on 25th August 2020 requesting a probe into the alleged bank fraud, after CBI had raised queries in an earlier complaint made in 2019.  In the case under investigation, there are 28 banks involved in the consortium with a huge amount of disbursement, with bank loans of various kinds under probe.  This includes CC Loan, Term Loan, Letters of Credit, and Bank Guarantees which were given as advance by the banks. After analysis of basic facts of the case, scrutiny, and discreet verification, CBI lodged an FIR on 7th February 2022. As part of the investigation, searches at 13 locations were conducted on 12th February which led to the recovery of several incriminating documents. This includes books of accounts of the accused borrower company, purchase/sale details, minutes of meetings of Board, share registers, and various contract files which are currently being scrutinised.

The aviation space is also grappling with various other issues like lower air traffic, inadequate hike in ticket prices, and a potential increase in competitive intensity. Air traffic is down nearly 25% from its recent peak, while competitive intensity is set to increase as new airlines will be starting operations soon.

One of the biggest beneficiaries for this announcement includes Mahindra Finance, where Morgan Stanley reported that the company is likely to postpone Rs 500-1500 crore provision for Q4FY22, which the management had guided.

Later, he setup a kirana store which failed and finally he settled for a tea stall. New opportunity came in 1983, in the form of a supervisor role at a roofing tile factory. At Rs 300 monthly salary, Mansukhbhai took up the new job and worked as a supervisor for about 5 years.  In 2001, when a devastating earthquake shook Gujarat, a simple newspaper clipping moved Mansukhbhai. With a picture of a broken earthern pot, the caption read –Poor man’s fridge shattered. Using his skills, Mansukhbhai embarked on a journey to develop earthern refrigerators that use no electricity and cost as less as Rs 3000. After several trials and errors, debt of Rs 19 lakh and four years of hardwork, he became successful in developing a clay fridge and thus started the journey of Mitticool.

Lifting the stay imposed by the Punjab & Haryana High Court on the implementation of the state law on 3rd February, the top court sent the case back to the High Court and mandated a decision within a month. Noting that the High Court didn't specify the reasons behind its order against presumptive legality in the legislation, the 2-judge bench of Justice LN Rao and Justice PS Narsimha asked the state government to refrain from taking any coercive action against employers who aren't compliant with the law as of now. While the apex court questioned how a law can be stayed by a one-line order, the petitioners before the High Court cited the example of the now-repealed farm laws which were stayed without any hearing on their constitutionality. While the top court noted that the need for employment can't be ignored in view of the presence of over 4 crore migrant workers in India, the petitioners questioned if a company lacking a specialist domain worker will wait to get an exemption from a government office if such a law is applied. Stating that almost every hospital has nurses from Kerala, the petitioners claimed that such a law will have profound effects on the idea of India as a whole. The petitioners pointed out that only 900 companies out of around 50,000 companies registered in Haryana have gotten themselves registered under the Act. Haryana government maintained that the law is prospective in nature and won't affect existing employees, claiming that there is a presumption of constitutionality in a law passed by a legislature. Contending that lack of opportunities for local youth had prompted such a law, the state government assured that industries not getting ample workers can apply for an exemption from the application of the law.

While the other Top 4 IT companies have declined anywhere between 10-25%; TCS has remained flat in CY22. Consequently, TCS has become more expensive than its peers - trading at 29 times FY23 earnings. This compares with Infosys which now trades at 25x FY23 earnings. Bloomberg consensus pegs 12-month target price for TCS at INR 4162, 10% higher than CMP. Separately, Infosys' consensus target price stands at INR 2181, return potential of over 25%. Experts believe while the buyback potential is attractive for TCS in the near term, the stock might lag once the event is over.

This is the newest development in one of India’s most fiercely fought corporate boardroom battles.   A three member bench, including the Chief Justice of India, agreed 2-1 to admit the review petition. It has been listed for March 9, 2022.  While the apex court has agreed to hear the review petition, it does not mean Cyrus Mistry will necessarily get relief.   He will,however, get another day in Court. Mistry was represented by Chambers of Jaitley & Bakshi.   A review petition being admitted is certainly rare, and a previous Supreme Court judgement being reversed is even more rare.

In this video, we bring to you the possibilities that could lead to a reduction in crude prices. The lifting of Iran sanctions, increased production of crude in the US, and OPEC+ either meeting their production target or aiming to produce more oil could lead to a reduction in crude prices. Even for India, Brent Crude around $100 per barrel level for a long time, is not a good sign. Higher crude prices will create inflationary pressure, increase input costs for many sectors, lead to higher import bills and also deteriorate the current account deficit.

A few days back, the Haryana state government has summited an appeal before the top court to make a law to reserve 75 per cent for local candidates in private sector jobs that offer a salary of less than Rs 30,000 a month. It claimed that there is no restraint against a state legislature from creating geographical classification to incentivise and grant concessions to citizens or industrial units. Haryana is not the only state who has attempted this, before this Madhya Pradesh, Andhra Pradesh, etc have tried to put this law in place. Now many questions arise that why policymakers want this law so deliberately? Does this really help to solve the problem of unemployment of the youth? Does it help or does it harm? To speak on the issue we are joined by experts, Madan Sabnavis, Jitendra Gupta, Rituparna Chakraborty.

However, when compared among four-wheelers and two-wheelers, it is the latter that is expected to get impacted the most. 2-wheelers have higher exposure to commodities like Aluminium, palladium, and rhodium – the prices of these commodities have moved higher by more than 20%. According to IIFL, two-wheelers would have to take a price hike of 2%-2.5% to fully pass on the recent rise in commodity prices and to maintain the gross margins at Q3 levels. However, doing so might hurt affordability and volumes in FY23.

It expects crude to touch these levels in the second quarter of the calendar year 2022. The bull case target for crude is $125/bbl.  According to the brokerage, the oil market was already tight, and in such situations, even a small disruption can have large price impacts. The only risk to Morgan Stanley’s crude target is the Iranian supply. It is currently expecting 1 mbpd of supplies between mid-to-end 2022.

The stock is also nearing bear market territory as it has declined nearly 20% from its recent peak. Rising crude price is the main reason behind this fall in share prices. Crude and crude derivatives account for nearly 60% of the raw material basket for a paint manufacturer. The prices of these raw materials increase, but with a lag. Hence, with Brent Crude above $115 per barrel, margins could get impacted in Q1FY23. However, the fall in share prices of Asian Paints is better than its peer. Despite the fall, the stock continues to trade 25% above the 52-week low, while its peers are less than 5% from their 52-week low.

Starting March 3, Indians will be able to create a Demat account with the exchange, based in India’s GIFT City, and invest in a small pool of U.S. stocks.  These stocks will not, however, be listed in India. Instead, investors will have the option of investing in depository receipts, a tradable instrument that represents the underlying asset. And, while the exchange has permission to eventually offer 50 U.S. stocks, it will only offer eight initially.  Though the offerings are currently limited, Shalini Sekhri, CEO of Cosmos Capital, believes the nature of depository receipts could be beneficial for small investors. In this episode of The ET Money Show, we discuss the pros and cons of the NSE IFSC’s new offering.

Multi-cap funds, which were meant to give investors exposure to companies across market capitalizations were, according to the regulator, not true to label.   Instead, a large number of these funds had high exposure to large-cap stocks. The regulator stepped in to stipulate that multi-cap funds would have to have at least 25 percent exposure each to large, mid, and small-cap stocks. But, based on dialogue with the mutual fund industry, it also created a new category of funds, called flexicap funds, and allowed asset management companies to reclassify their multicap funds under the new category.   On The ET Money Show, we discuss what the two mutual fund categories are meant to achieve and where they fit in your portfolio.

The main reason behind this decline is the rise in gas prices. Spot gas prices have surged over 40% to $43.6 per million British thermal units. Gas is the major raw material and accounts for around 25% to 35% of the total cost. Rising gas prices will increase the cost of production and the same will impact their gross margins. Tile manufacturers have the option to take a price hike, but doing so could impact demand, according to JMFinancials.

Indian Railways via an order yesterday said "In trains which are already restored with regular train numbers, 2nd class accommodation shall be earmarked for the reserved or the unreserved as per applicability during the pre-pandemic period". 2S class tickets accounted for 39% of IRCTC’s ticketing volumes in 3QFY22 and around 20% of its total PAT. During the pandemic, to maintain social distancing at the counter and inside the trains, railways had decided that all tickets should be available only on reservation basis. The Ministry had converted unreserved coaches into 2S class which required mandatory reservation. This, is now being restored. This restoration is negative for IRCTC as IRCTC will be losing out on the reservation charge element which IRCTC was earning due to online booking.
