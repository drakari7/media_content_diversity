Hijab Row: Should Religious Dress-Codes Come At The Cost Of Education?\#\9,459 views\#\2022-02-14\#\NDTV 24x7, Karnataka Hijab Row, Muslim girls in Hijab, Hijab Controversy, Hijab, girls in Hijab, Karnataka Hijab girls, Hijab in school, Karnataka Hijab controversy, Hijab ban in school, Karnatka Hijab row, Muslim students, Udupi Students, tv show, anchor= vishnu som, left right and centre, Vishnu Som, Discussion\#\There is no law that prohibits the use of headscarves in educational institutions, is what lawyers representing students who insist on wearing the hijab to educational institutes today argued in the Karnataka High Court. While the hearings continue, the key argument being made was that the hijab was mandatory as per the Quran, and that there is no authority which can say no to its use unless there is a law and order issue. Today though, there were several unfortunate scenes in the districts of Karnataka which have seen the hijab row. There were students who chose not to attend school if they were not allowed to wear the hijab. Elsewhere, there were videos of women having to remove their hijab under public glare before being allowed to enter schools and colleges and there was also a video of a little girl torn between what her father wanted - for her to keep wearing her hijab - and a school teacher who said rules were rules. These are all perspectives in what appears to have become a difficult debate. We just have one question, since education is fundamental, shouldn't everyone prioritise that and attend school even as we wait for the outcome of the court judgement?

Last time, the party won 15 of its 47 seats here despite a dismal performance elsewhere. Many of the districts that saw polling today have a sizable Muslim population, and the SP-RLD Alliance is hoping to retain that vote and drawing votes from scheduled castes and non-Yadav, OBC communities too. Also in the mix is the Congress that won 2 of the 55 seats last time. The big battle is in Rampur - jailed Lok Sabha MP and Samajwadi Party leader Azam Khan against the BJP's Akash Saxena and the ex-royal Nawab Qasim Ali from the Congress. The Nawab feels that nine-time MLA Azam Khan will get no sympathy for being in jail.

The college administration argued that they were only following interim orders of the court, which had allowed schools and colleges to resume only on the condition that no religious clothing be allowed in classrooms. The students, however, say the college did not inform them that they would not be allowed in hijabs or burkhas.

It's with an eye on this vote, that parties are outdoing themselves to pay homage today on the anniversary of Guru Ravidas, the 16th century saint. From the PM to the UP Chief Minister, making inroads into the Dalit vote has been crucial in powering the BJP to victory in 2017, the party winning 69 of the state's 84 reserved SC seats. Given the traditional dominance of Mayawati's BSP on the Dalit vote, key to the BJP's strategy has been to target Dalit sub castes that feel side-lined by the BSP. Dalits make up about 20 per cent of UP's population of which half  - 10 per cent are Jatav sub caste, loyal to the BSP. It's the remaining 10 per cent non-Jatav Dalits, made up of sub castes like Valmikis, Khateeks, Pasis, and so on, that the BJP has cultivated that helped the BJP sweep the Bundelkhand region, winning all 19 of the seats in this region.

The move has provoked worldwide condemnation. In response to the invasion, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky on Thursday broke off Kyiv's diplomatic relations with Moscow. He compared Russia's invasion of his country to military campaigns carried out by Nazi Germany during World War II. The situation has given rise to the fear that the region could be severely destabilized if the hostility between the two countries is not pacified.

Stung by criticism that it is not doing enough to help rescue Indians stranded in Ukraine, videos of which have flooded social media, the government has gone into damage control mode. In somewhat of a reversal from its earlier responses, where partly it appeared to blame the students for ignoring multiple advisories to vacate the country, the government now seems to want to convey a sense of urgency and empathy. But is there a gap between government advisories and ground realities? We investigate on this episode of Reality Check.

Students allege that the Indian embassy in Kiev has not made any arrangements to move Indian citizens to safe places. Students have had to walk tens of kilometres to reach border check-posts as buses they travelled in dropped them much ahead of the country's borders. On Prime Time, we ask whether the government is doing enough to ensure safety of Indian citizens caught in the middle of a war in Ukraine.

"I heard the speech he gave in Balia. He spoke about family and nepotism 15 times in his speech. And in the whole day, he must have spoken at least 25 times about extreme nepotism. I want to ask him that just because nobody is talking about his family, does not mean he's not family-oriented," Mr Yadav, 48, told NDTV in an interview. Exuding confidence about emerging victorious when results are announced on March 10, Akhilesh Yadav said, "This time there's more enthusiasm and energy... This is the first election where I am seeing people coming of their own will. We want change, but more than us, these people want change."

Former National Security Adviser John Bolton was NSA during what became Trump's Ukraine-gate. In 2019, President Trump delayed US military aid to Ukraine while he pressured Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy for dirt on then-presidential candidate Joe Biden, particularly on millions of dollars of allegedly dodgy investments made in Ukraine by Biden's son Hunter. It's one of the reasons John Bolton is said to have quit as NSA. We speak exclusively with John Bolton.
