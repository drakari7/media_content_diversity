While the Gandhis had already made up their mind about Sidhu, they were hesitant for a moment on seeing the strong stand taken by Chief Minister Captain Amarinder Singh, who made it clear that he would not meet Sidhu till the latter apologises to him.

The Gandhis realised that if they backtracked this time after having made up their mind on Sidhu as Congress chief, their already shaky grip over the party would be shook further.  The Captain has made it clear he would be no pushover and hence, had some tough talk with Punjab in-charge Harish Rawat.

Meanwhile, 38,660 patients recovered and the vaccination tally reached 40,64,81,493 during the same period.  As India is bracing for an imminent third wave of Covid-19, the Centre has geared up to build a 30-day buffer stock or inventory of essential Covid-19 medicines like Remdesivir and Favipiravir. Apart from the life-saving drugs, the government is also restocking common drugs and supplements like paracetamol, antibiotics, and vitamins.  Congress leader Rahul Gandhi, BJP ministers Ashwini Vaishnaw and Prahlad Singh Patel, and political strategist Prashant Kishor were among the potential targets of surveillance through Pegasus, an Israeli spyware, according to news website The Wire.  The website is part of a 17-member consortium that acted as media partners to an investigation by Paris-based non-profit organisation Forbidden Stories and rights group Amnesty International into a leaked list of over 50,000 phone numbers across the world that are believed to have been the target of surveillance through Pegasus.  More than 300 verified mobile phone numbers, including of two serving ministers, 40 journalists, three opposition leaders, and one sitting judge besides scores of business persons and activists in India were possibly targeted for hacking through the Israeli spyware sold only to government agencies, the international media consortium reported on Sunday.

After the Prime Minister’s speech, Union Minister Rajnath Singh slammed the opposition and said, “What the Congress did is extremely sad and unfortunate. PM could not even introduce his ministers."  While interacting with journalists before the session of the parliament, PM Modi urged MPs and political parties to ask the sharpest and toughest of questions to the government in the Monsoon session of Parliament, asserting that the government should also be allowed to respond to them.  “I urge all MPs and political parties to ask the sharpest and the toughest of questions but they should also allow the government to respond in a cordial environment as democracy is strengthened by conveying the truth to the people," Modi said.

It remains to be seen if Sidhu will apologize as demanded by the CM. With the appointment of Navjot Singh Sidhu as PCC chief, the Gandhis have made it clear that they are the boss. While the Gandhis had already made up their mind about Sidhu, they were hesitant for a moment on seeing the strong stand taken by Chief Minister Captain Amarinder Singh, who made it clear that he would not meet Sidhu till the latter apologises to him.  Sources say Sonia Gandhi was rattled and wondered if she should postpone a decision but when Partap Singh Bajwa held a meeting with Punjab MPs in an attempt to show eyes to the top leadership, the die was cast and Sidhu was finally appointed PCC chief in a late-night declaration.  The Gandhis realised that if they backtracked this time after having made up their mind on Sidhu as Congress chief, their already shaky grip over the party would be shook further.  The Captain has made it clear he would be no pushover and hence, had some tough talk with Punjab in-charge Harish Rawat. The four working presidents have been carefully chosen — not only do they get the regional balance right, but most of them are close to Rahul Gandhi.

In the Captain versus Skipper tussle inside the Congress in Punjab, Navjot Singh Sidhu has now got the upper hand by being appointed as the Punjab Congress Chief against the wishes of Chief Minister Captain Amarinder Singh. This is set to spice up the three-cornered election in Punjab in 2022.  The party sees it as a smart move to bring a fresh face forward in Sidhu to blunt the anti-incumbency and general negativity against the Captain-led Congress in Punjab, attempt a generational change with Captain touching 80 as the oldest serving CM in the country, and most importantly assert the party High Command’s dominance and control. Captain, however, remains a master of underarm bowling with many tricks up his veteran sleeve and would look to trump Sidhu post elections to the CM’s chair if the party wins.  Congress Vs Congress  The manner in which the appointment finally came, amidst persisting acrimony, shows it is now Congress versus Congress first in Punjab. The chief minister has said he would meet Sidhu only after a public apology from him for his statements against the CM in tweets and media interviews.   The CM’s letter and phone call to Sonia Gandhi to not make Sidhu the party chief has also fallen on deaf ears. The two may eventually share a campaign stage and have a photo-op soon with a customary Punjabi jhappi (hug) but their mutual mistrust and a bitter tussle on ticket distribution is imminent.  The real grouse in Captain’s camp remains that Sidhu used his access to Priyanka Gandhi Vadra to get what he wanted and a seemingly winnable election till three months ago has been botched up with poor handling by the high command.  But Vadra convinced Rahul Gandhi and Sonia Gandhi on Sidhu’s case that the party can win in Punjab only if Sidhu gets a top position or anti-incumbency will drown the party. Congress is attempting something it did not in Madhya Pradesh with Jyotiraditya Scindia or in Rajasthan with Sachin Pilot – making space right at top for young blood.   The high command has also sent a message that its decision matters the most. Captain may still be made the head of the campaign committee to soften this blow while Rajya Sabha MP Partap Singh Bajwa may get charge of the manifesto committee. But the creation of the two power centers, one in the party and the other in government, may mean the two will work at cross-ends rather than together as the moot issue now will be who becomes CM if Congress wins in Punjab. What does not help is Captain not having a high opinion about Sidhu’s electoral appeal or administrative skills and considering him unreliable and one propped up with no real support base.  Sidhu has tried to lately counter that criticism by meeting a battery of MLAs, ministers and former Punjab Congress chiefs to project a more accommodative version of himself, even as Captain made his moves to derail the impending appointment. Seeing the winds of change and the ‘future’, many MLAs and ministers have made a beeline for Sidhu now.   “His campaign will be high-voltage. He will take on the Badals like no one else. It will electrify the Congress cadre and set the tone for the elections after his visit to Amritsar and Golden Temple,” an MLA aide of Sidhu said.

During the all-party meet, opposition parties objected to the government’s offer for a joint address to all MPs by the prime minister on COVID-19 at the Parliament annexe, saying this will be “highly irregular” at a time when Parliament will be in session and it aims to “bypass” norms. The meeting was attended by 33 parties.  Leaders, including from the Trinamool Congress (TMC) and the CPI(M), also said that when the pandemic and issues related to it can be discussed on the floor of the House, what was the need to go “outside”. The annexe is a separate building within the premises of the Parliament complex.  Parliamentary Affairs Minister Prahlad Joshi announced at the meeting that Prime Minister Modi will address MPs of both the Houses — Rajya Sabha and Lok Sabha — on July 20 and speak on the pandemic. “What is the need to go outside Parliament? Any address should be on the floor of the House,” TMC Rajya Sabha member Derek O’Brien, who was at the meeting, said.  Sources in other opposition parties confirmed that Joshi’s offer has been refused and that some have even suggested a joint sitting of the Houses at Central Hall. CPI(M) general secretary Sitaram Yechury said that the party’s position has always been that when Parliament is in session, whatever the government has to say, it can do so on the floor of the House.  “It is highly irregular for the government to do this. When the Parliament is in session, any address or presentation the government wants to make, it has to be done from inside Parliament,” he said. O’Brien claimed that all opposition leaders present in the meeting, including Leader of Opposition in Rajya Sabha Mallikarjun Kharge, Leader of Congress in Lok Sabha Adhir Ranjan Chowdhury, Samajwadi Party’s Ramgopal Yadav and Bahujan Samaj Party’s Satish Misra refused to be addressed “outside” Parliament.  In another development, various parties, including the Congress and the TMC, on Sunday demanded restoration of MPLAD funds, in an all-party meeting chaired by Lok Sabha Speaker Om Birla, sources said. Speaker Birla assured them that he will raise the issue with the government and its top functionaries, they said.  The government has listed 17 new bills for introduction in the session. Three of the bills seek to replace ordinances issued recently.  One of the ordinances issued on June 30, prohibits any agitation and strike by anyone engaged in the essential defence services. The Essential Defence Services Ordinance 2021 came in the backdrop of the announcement by major federations of the Ordnance Factory Board (OFB) to go on an indefinite strike from the later part of July to protest the government’s decision to corporatise the OFB.  The Essential Defence Service Bill, 2021 has been listed to replace the ordinance, according to a Lok Sabha bulletin issued on July 12. The Commission for Air Quality Management in National Capital Region and Adjoining Areas Bill, 2021 is another measure that seeks to replace an ordinance.

IMA is in talks with the Kerala govt over lifting covid restrictions around Barkri Eid in the state The Kerela govt has said they are looking into IMA's request and could tweak/withdraw order in a day or two.   Depending on the revert, IMA will consider its next step.  - IMA is likely to approach SC if order not withdrawn. The Kerala government could change or withdraw its order issued on Saturday on easing Covid restrictions around Eid-ul-Azha (Bakrid) celebrations in the state after the Indian Medical Association’s (IMA) warning on imminent third wave.  The IMA, the largest body of doctors in India, had warned the state government that it would approach the Supreme Court over easing of restrictions on pretext of religious gatherings around Bakrid amid the rising Covid cases in the state. The IMA had warned the state government over lifting Covid curbs ahead of the festival and called its decision as “retrograde”. It also cautioned that the third wave may be imminent if appropriate measures were not being taken.  The association also said it was inappropriate on the part of the state government to issue such an order during a medical emergency when north Indian states such as Uttar Pradesh and Uttarakhand have cancelled “with a constructive sense of public safety the traditional and popular pilgrimage Yatras”.  Meanwhile, the Supreme Court seeks the Kerala government’s response on plea against its decision of easing restrictions ahead of Bakrid. The SC will hear the case on Tuesday.  The state recorded 16,148 new Covid cases, its highest single day rise in more than a month. The test positivity rate has shot up above 10%, which requires following restrictions according to ICMR guidelines.  The government on Saturday relaxed Covid-19 lockdown restrictions on 18, 19, and 20 July in view of Eid-ul-Azha (Bakrid) celebrations.  The state government issued new guidelines under five categories of districts based on the test positivity rates. TPR below 5 is category A, between 5 to 10 is category B, 10 to 15 is category C and TPR above 15 is category ‘D’.

Amid the uproar, the Prime Minister retorted, “I thought that there would be enthusiasm in the Parliament as so many women, Dalits, tribals have become Ministers.

Earlier this month, PM Modi had added 36 new ministers to his government, in the first cabinet reshuffle since he was elected for a second term in 2019.  Several parties including the Congress, SAD, CPI(M) on Monday had moved adjournment notices to discuss farm laws, fuel hike and related issues in the parliament.  The opposition kept shouting slogans as Speaker Om Birla requested the members to maintain decorum in the house. “You are bringing down the standards of parliamentary democracy, we are the largest democracy in the world," he was heard saying.  After the Prime Minister’s speech, Union Minister Rajnath Singh slammed the opposition and said, “What the Congress did is extremely sad and unfortunate. PM could not even introduce his ministers."  While interacting with journalists before the session of the parliament, PM Modi urged MPs and political parties to ask the sharpest and toughest of questions to the government in the Monsoon session of Parliament, asserting that the government should also be allowed to respond to them.  “I urge all MPs and political parties to ask the sharpest and the toughest of questions but they should also allow the government to respond in a cordial environment as democracy is strengthened by conveying the truth to the people," Modi said.

Commuters face the brunt. Waterlogging major issue. #MonsoonMayhem #DelhiRains #DelhiNews Immersion in water can wreak havoc on a car, especially its engine, electrical system, and interior. While Mumbai is notorious for water clogged roads every monsoon season, Delhi-NCR is inching close despite having better quality infrastructure as indicated in many studies.   However, the heavy downpour in the national capital region for the last couple of days has left everyone wondering if civic bodies have the understanding of road construction. Images are surfacing from Delhi, Gurgaon, Ghaziabad as major roads are submerged in water, especially underpasses, which are often at high risk of water clogging.  In the past, we have seen devastating floods that destructed a lot of cars in Chennai and Mumbai. If your car has been immersed in water more than halfway up its wheels, follow these 10 steps compiled by Code6, an aftermarket engine remapping company based in Kochi.  1. Do not attempt to start the car  -It’s tempting to turn the key and see if the car still works, but if there is water in the engine, attempting to start it could damage it beyond repair. If in doubt, it is best to have the car towed to a mechanic.  2. Determine how deep the car was submerged  -Mud and debris usually leave a waterline on the car inside as well as outside. If the water did not rise above the bottom of the doors, your car will probably be fine. Most insurance companies will consider the car totalled (damaged beyond economically-reasonable repair) if water reaches the bottom of the dashboard.  3. Call your insurance company  -Flood damage is generally covered by comprehensive (fire and theft) insurance, so even if you don’t have collision coverage, you may be covered for repairs or replacement. Your insurance company will probably be flooded with claims, so it’s a good idea to start the process early.  4. Start drying the interior  -If water got inside the car, mould will grow quickly. Start by opening the doors and windows and putting towels on the floor to soak up water, but you should plan on replacing anything that got wet, including carpets, floor mats, door panels, seat padding and upholstery. Remember, these repairs are likely to be covered by your comprehensive insurance.  5. Check the oil and the air cleaner  -If you see droplets of water in the dipstick or the level of the oil is high, or if the air filter has water in it, do not attempt to start the engine. Have it towed to a mechanic to have the water cleared and the fluids changed. (Hard-core do-it-yourselfers can try changing the oil, then removing the spark plugs and cranking the engine to blow out the water, but we still recommend leaving this to the mechanic.)  6. Check all the other fluids  -Fuel systems on late model cars are usually sealed, but older cars may need to have their fuel systems drained. Brake, clutch, power steering and coolant reservoirs should be checked for contamination.   7. Check all of the electrical systems  -If the engine looks Ok to start, check everything electrical: headlights, turn signals, air conditioning, stereo, power locks, windows and seats, even the interior lights. If you note anything even slightly amiss, including the way the car runs or the transmission shifts, that could be a sign of electrical trouble. Take the car to a mechanic and remember that the damage may be covered by insurance.  8. Check around the wheels and tyres  -Before attempting to move the car, look for debris lodged around the wheels, brakes and underbody. (Set the parking brake before crawling around the wheels).

Members of Parliament in Rajya Sabha paid tribute to MPs and personalities who lost their lives this year, including veteran actor Dilip Kumar and veteran athlete Milkha Singh "I thought there would be an atmosphere of excitement in the house. We welcome new women and Dalit MPs. I wanted to introduce MPs. Few people don't want Dalit MPs becoming minister, women becoming ministers," PM Modi said as the opposition parties create ruckus in the Parliament. I would like to urge all the MPs and all the parties to ask the most difficult and sharpest questions in the Houses but should also allow the Govt to respond, in a disciplined environment.

What is expected from the day-1 of the monsoon session of the Parliament? Leaders, including from the Trinamool Congress (TMC) and the CPI(M), also said that when the pandemic and issues related to it can be discussed on the floor of the House, what was the need to go “outside”. The annexe is a separate building within the premises of the Parliament complex.  Parliamentary Affairs Minister Prahlad Joshi announced at the meeting that Prime Minister Modi will address MPs of both the Houses — Rajya Sabha and Lok Sabha — on July 20 and speak on the pandemic. “What is the need to go outside Parliament? Any address should be on the floor of the House,” TMC Rajya Sabha member Derek O’Brien, who was at the meeting, said.  Sources in other opposition parties confirmed that Joshi’s offer has been refused and that some have even suggested a joint sitting of the Houses at Central Hall. CPI(M) general secretary Sitaram Yechury said that the party’s position has always been that when Parliament is in session, whatever the government has to say, it can do so on the floor of the House.  “It is highly irregular for the government to do this. When the Parliament is in session, any address or presentation the government wants to make, it has to be done from inside Parliament,” he said. O’Brien claimed that all opposition leaders present in the meeting, including Leader of Opposition in Rajya Sabha Mallikarjun Kharge, Leader of Congress in Lok Sabha Adhir Ranjan Chowdhury, Samajwadi Party’s Ramgopal Yadav and Bahujan Samaj Party’s Satish Misra refused to be addressed “outside” Parliament.  In another development, various parties, including the Congress and the TMC, on Sunday demanded restoration of MPLAD funds, in an all-party meeting chaired by Lok Sabha Speaker Om Birla, sources said. Speaker Birla assured them that he will raise the issue with the government and its top functionaries, they said.  The government has listed 17 new bills for introduction in the session. Three of the bills seek to replace ordinances issued recently.  One of the ordinances issued on June 30, prohibits any agitation and strike by anyone engaged in the essential defence services. The Essential Defence Services Ordinance 2021 came in the backdrop of the announcement by major federations of the Ordnance Factory Board (OFB) to go on an indefinite strike from the later part of July to protest the government’s decision to corporatise the OFB.  The Essential Defence Service Bill, 2021 has been listed to replace the ordinance, according to a Lok Sabha bulletin issued on July 12. The Commission for Air Quality Management in National Capital Region and Adjoining Areas Bill, 2021 is another measure that seeks to replace an ordinance.  According to the government, the ordinance was brought to provide a permanent solution and establish a self-regulated, democratically monitored mechanism for tackling air pollution in the NCR and adjoining areas, rather than limited ad-hoc measures. The Opposition on its part wants raise issues like alleged shortcomings in the healthcare system during the second wave of the coronavirus pandemic and the distribution of COVID-19 vaccines to states.

Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Sunday told an all-party meeting that the government was ready for a healthy and meaningful discussion on various issues in Parliament, according to Parliamentary Affairs Minister Prahlad Joshi.  An official statement later said the PM told the floor leaders that according to the country’s traditions of healthy democracy, issues concerning the people should be raised in an amicable manner and the government should be given an opportunity to respond to these discussions. Modi said it is everyone’s responsibility to create such a conducive environment and added that people’s representatives truly know the ground-level situation, hence their participation in these discussions enriches the decision-making process.  The Pegasus spyware was used to hack phones of Indian politicians, journalists and activists, said a report quoting an investigation by a group of 17 global media organisations, a claim that was denied by the central government.  The government said in its response that “no unauthorised interception" has taken place and that the report is not only “bereft of facts” but also “founded in pre-conceived conclusions”.  The report published by online news platform The Wire said the leaked data includes the numbers of top journalists at big media houses. It also said the data shows that most of the names were targeted between 2018 and 2019, in the run-up to the 2019 Lok Sabha general elections.  The report said the presence of a phone number in the data does alone not reveal whether a device was infected with Pegasus or subject to an attempted hack. “However, the Pegasus Project that analysed this list believes the data is indicative of potential targets identified in advance of possible surveillance attempts,” it said.

It remains to be seen if Sidhu will apologize as demanded by the CM. With the appointment of Navjot Singh Sidhu as PCC chief, the Gandhis have made it clear that they are the boss. While the Gandhis had already made up their mind about Sidhu, they were hesitant for a moment on seeing the strong stand taken by Chief Minister Captain Amarinder Singh, who made it clear that he would not meet Sidhu till the latter apologises to him.  Sources say Sonia Gandhi was rattled and wondered if she should postpone a decision but when Partap Singh Bajwa held a meeting with Punjab MPs in an attempt to show eyes to the top leadership, the die was cast and Sidhu was finally appointed PCC chief in a late-night declaration.  The Gandhis realised that if they backtracked this time after having made up their mind on Sidhu as Congress chief, their already shaky grip over the party would be shook further.  The Captain has made it clear he would be no pushover and hence, had some tough talk with Punjab in-charge Harish Rawat. The four working presidents have been carefully chosen — not only do they get the regional balance right, but most of them are close to Rahul Gandhi.

Pegasus: Storm Builds Up Over The Spyware | Snoopgate Row | India Latest News | CNN News18\#\1,752 views\#\Jul 19, 2021\#\pegasus, america, indian journalists, politicians, nso spyware, cnn news18, news18, cnn, cnn news18 live, cnn live, latest news, news today, news, India today live, cnn ibn live, news18 live, live news english, news live, live news india, ibn live, cnn news live stream, cnn news 18, india today\#\#Breaking | #Pegasus 'Snoopgate' row: Centre puts out the facts.  The allegations regarding government surveillance on specific people has no concrete basis or truth associated with it whatsoever. In the past, similar claims were made regarding the use of Pegasus on WhatsApp by Indian State. Those reports also had no factual basis and were categorically denied by all parties, including WhatsApp in the Indian Supreme Court. This news report, thus, also appears to be a similar fishing expedition, based on conjectures and exaggerations to malign the Indian democracy and its institutions. The Pegasus spyware was used to hack phones of Indian politicians, journalists and activists, said a report quoting an investigation by a group of 17 global media organisations, a claim that was denied by the central government.  The government said in its response that “no unauthorised interception" has taken place and that the report is not only “bereft of facts” but also “founded in pre-conceived conclusions”.  The report published by online news platform The Wire said the leaked data includes the numbers of top journalists at big media houses. It also said the data shows that most of the names were targeted between 2018 and 2019, in the run-up to the 2019 Lok Sabha general elections.  The report said the presence of a phone number in the data does alone not reveal whether a device was infected with Pegasus or subject to an attempted hack. “However, the Pegasus Project that analysed this list believes the data is indicative of potential targets identified in advance of possible surveillance attempts,” it said.   Pegasus is sold by the Israeli company NSO Group, which says it only offers its spyware to “vetted governments”, according to the report. Pegasus was in the news in 2019 when it was found that spies used the spyware to hack into phones of roughly 1,400 users around the world, including 121 Indians.  NO ‘CONCRETE BASIS OR TRUTH’ The Union government, however, dismissed the claims of snooping, saying the allegations have no “concrete basis or truth associated with it whatsoever”.  “India is a robust democracy that is committed to ensuring the right to privacy to all its citizens as a fundamental right. In furtherance of this commitment, it has also introduced the Personal Data Protection Bill, 2019 and the Information Technology (Intermediary Guidelines and Digital Media Ethics Code) Rules, 2021, to protect the personal data of individuals and to empower users of social media platforms.”  “India’s Minister of Electronics & IT has also spoken in detail, including in the Parliament, that there has been no unauthorised interception by Government agencies. It is important to note that Government agencies have a well-established protocol for interception, which includes sanction and supervision from highly ranked officials in central & state governments, for clear stated reasons only in national interest,” the statement said.  Stating that in the past too, similar claims were made regarding the use of Pegasus on WhatsApp, the government said, “Those reports also had no factual basis and were categorically denied by all parties, including WhatsApp in the Indian Supreme Court.”  “This news report, thus, also appears to be a similar fishing expedition, based on conjectures and exaggerations to malign the Indian democracy and its institutions,” it added.

The Supreme Court on Wednesday took cognisance of the Uttar Pradesh government’s decision to allow ‘Kanwar Yatra‘ in the state in the wake of the Covid-19 pandemic. A bench headed by Justice RF Nariman issued a notice to the state government and posted the matter for hearing on Friday.  “I read something. The citizens of India are completely perplexed. They don’t know what is going on. And all this amid the prime minister’s warning against third Covid wave, and saying that we cannot compromise even one bit," said Justice Nariman while issuing the notice.  The Yogi Adityanath government on Tuesday allowed the yatra from July 25 despite concerns raised in various quarters over the risk posed by such events in triggering a possible third wave of Covid-19.  “This is a matter of people’s faith. The government only makes the arrangements for this. It is only on the basis of arrangements by the government that we have defeated the first and the second wave of coronavirus. The notice by the Supreme Court has come to my knowledge, we will file our reply after discussion with the chief minister," UP health minister Jai Pratap Singh said.

Navjot Singh Sidhu’s impending appointment as the President of the Punjab Pradesh Congress Committee (PPCC) could mean he would be Captain Amarinder Singh’s successor and maybe the Chief Minister of the state sometime in the future if the Congress wins in 2022 in Punjab.  Chief Minister Captain Amarinder Singh’s media advisor on Thursday said Singh “will lead the party to victory in the 2022 polls as he did in 2017”, implying that 79-year-old Singh is in no mood to hang his boots. The party is going into the elections with Singh as the CM but Sidhu’s probable appointment as the PPCC Chief clears the succession path for the party in Punjab as the High Command does see Sidhu as the “future”. Who becomes the CM also depends on whom the majority of MLAs support, which is presently enjoyed by Captain Amarinder Singh.  There are latest precedents in the Congress of PCC Chiefs becoming the CMs if a majority of the winning MLAs back the person, which is sometimes the case as the PCC Chief has a major say in deciding tickets. In fact, before the 2017 assembly elections in Punjab in a similar set of circumstances, Captain Amarinder Singh had forced the Congress High Command to appoint him as the PPCC Chief replacing Partap Singh Bajwa, his known detractor. Singh got the post and later Rahul Gandhi also announced him as the CM face just on the eve of the elections. Now, Sidhu seems to be forcing the High Command’s hand to extend him the same favour.

The post had fallen vacant after the death of former Chief Secretary YS Ratra in April.  On the face of it, party insiders say, the appointment would seem a routine one but this one has major strategic political ramification. One, to tide over resentment among a section of the party that the CM was not ‘listening’ to the demands of the regional leaders, the CM was now making political appointments to boards and corporation rather than get bureaucrats to run them.  Secondly, Lalli Majithia, according to party sources, has been the biggest counter to senior Akal Dal leader Bikram Singh Majithia in the Majha region. “This can take the sting out of the allegations that Captain was soft on Akalis and was shying away from propping up leaders who are taking them head-on,’’ commented a party leader.  The move also, according to sources, helps the CM counter the Majha brigade in the Punjab Congress. Cabinet ministers Tript Rajinder Bajwa, Sukhbinder Singh Sarkaria and Sukhjinder Randhawa, along with some MLAs, who are seen as part of the Majha brigade, had reportedly joined hands with the dissidents against the CM.  These leaders, who form the core of the Majha leadership in the Congress, have till recently been siding with Capt Amarinder which has helped him neutralise the threat from the likes of Rajya Sabha MP Partap Singh Bajwa. But the recent cracks that have surfaced in the party over the sacrilege case handling has left the Majha brigade on the other side of the fence leaving the Captain camp worried.  “Now, since it’s increasingly getting clear that the Captain is staying as the CM, he needs to look at a new local leadership from politically important regions like Majha which will help him neutralise to some extent the threats from dissidents,” commented a senior party leader.

We are loyal Congress workers. We will Punjab Polls 2022.  Bajwa has opposed Navjot Singh Sidhu to be appointed as PCC Chief.  Sources said that the CM has appointed Sukhjinder Raj Singh alias Lalli Majithia, a veteran leader from the politically significant Majha region as the Chairman of the Punjab State Grain Procurement Corporation (Pungrain), an important body that draws linkages to the farmers in the state. The post had fallen vacant after the death of former Chief Secretary YS Ratra in April.  On the face of it, party insiders say, the appointment would seem a routine one but this one has major strategic political ramification. One, to tide over resentment among a section of the party that the CM was not ‘listening’ to the demands of the regional leaders, the CM was now making political appointments to boards and corporation rather than get bureaucrats to run them.  Secondly, Lalli Majithia, according to party sources, has been the biggest counter to senior Akal Dal leader Bikram Singh Majithia in the Majha region. “This can take the sting out of the allegations that Captain was soft on Akalis and was shying away from propping up leaders who are taking them head-on,’’ commented a party leader.

The people of the Kisan union are urged to leave the path of agitation & adopt the path of discussion: Narendra Singh Tomar.   Amid ongoing party feud in Punjab, Congress MP Manish Tewari on Saturday hailed the coming together of Chief Minister Amarinder Singh and former PPCC president Pratap Singh Bajwa, who have been at loggerheads for long. Bajwa, who was replaced as party’s state unit chief by Sunil Jakhar at the Captain’s behest, has been a constant critic of the Amarinder Singh government. However, on Saturday, the two leaders, curiously sporting similar coloured turbans, not only met, but also shared smiles and posed for photos.  This union, however, may not bode well for Navjot Singh Sidhu, who is looking at being appointed as the Punjab Congress chief. Sidhu, who has been engaged in a bitter conflict with the Captain with their hostilities out in the open, has held parleys with the Gandhi siblings in Delhi amid rumours of his possible elevation. However, Bajwa has opposed the idea of Sidhu’s appointment as the Punjab Pradesh Congress Committee (PPCC) president.   Bajwa, who has for long been in agreement with other dissident leaders in the state seeking the ouster of Chief Minister Amarinder Singh, is learnt to have “sealed” a political compromise with his political rival. Bajwa had also mended his differences with Sukhjinder Randhawa and even joined hands with Sidhu.  According to sources, a senior Congress leader has also conveyed to Sonia Gandhi a few party members’ opposition to Sidhu’s promotion, allegedly saying “he does not even know the road to the PPCC office in Chandigarh".

The people of the Kisan union are urged to leave the path of agitation & adopt the path of discussion: Narendra Singh Tomar.  Earlier : APMC mandis will now be eligible to avail financial support from the Rs 1 lakh crore Agriculture Infrastructure Fund to expand the regulated markets' capacity and provide better facilities to farmers, Agriculture Minister Narendra Singh Tomar said on Thursday. Tomar also asserted that the decision to further strengthen the Agricultural Produce Market Committees (APMCs) allays protesting farmers' fear that these mandis will scrapped with the implementation of three controversial agriculture laws.  This modification in the central scheme was approved in the cabinet meeting chaired by Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Thursday. Briefing media about the cabinet decision, Tomar said: "During the Budget (2021-22), we had told that APMCs will not end, rather they would be strengthened further. Keeping that in mind, the Cabinet today decided to allow APMC to utilise the Rs 1 lakh crore financing facility under Agriculture Infrastructure Fund (AIF)." Stating that there was apprehension that APMCs will be abolished, the minister reiterated that these regulated mandis will not end. "After implementation of the three farm laws, APMC will get funds from this agri-infra fund." For APMCs, interest subvention for a loan up to Rs 2 crore will be provided for each project of different infrastructure types like cold storage, sorting, grading and assaying units and silos within the same market yard, he added.  APMC markets are set up to provide market linkages and create an ecosystem of post-harvest public infrastructure open to all farmers Not only APMCs, Tomar said the financial facility under this fund has been extended to state agencies, national and state federations, farmer producer organisations (FPOs) as well as federation of self-help groups (SHGs). So far, individuals, organisations, cooperatives, FPOs and agri-start ups and farmers organisations were eligible to avail subvention of 3 per cent per annum for loans up to Rs 2 crore, he added.  Under the AIF, a medium to long-term debt financing facility is provided for investment in viable projects for post-harvest management infrastructure and community farming assets through interest subvention and financial support. Among other changes in the scheme, the minister said that currently interest subvention for a loan up to Rs 2 crore in one location is eligible under the scheme. Location will mean physical boundary of a village or town having a distinct LGD (Local Government Directory) code. Each of such projects should be in a location having a separate LGD code. The minister further said the period of financial facility has been extended from 4 to 6 years up to 2025-26. The overall period of the scheme has been extended from 10 to 13 years up to 2032-33.  In a separate statement, the government said the power has been delegated to the Union Agriculture Minister to make necessary changes with regard to addition or deletion of beneficiaries in such a manner so that basic spirit of the scheme is not altered. The modifications in the scheme will help to achieve a multiplier effect in generating investments while ensuring that the benefits reach small and marginal farmers, it said.

Twelve people were killed and several others feared trapped under debris after a wall collapsed on shanties in Chembur in Mumbai today due to a landslide after incessant downpour through the night. In a similar incident, three people were killed and two injured in Vikhroli where some hutments collapsed due to a landslide. In Chembur, a team of the National Disaster Response Force (NDRF) has reached the Bharat Nagar area where a number of shanties were reduced to rubble and a rescue operation is underway. Six bodies were pulled out by the local BMC workers and fire brigade personnel and the NDRF has so far recovered one. Close to eight people are still feared to be trapped.  Incessant overnight rains threw parts of Mumbai out of gear on Sunday with the city witnessing severe waterlogging, disruption of local train services and vehicular traffic. The rain fury reminded some Mumbaikars of the 24-hour rainfall figure of 944 mm on July 26, 2005. The India Meteorological Department (IMD) has issued a red alert for Mumbai in the backdrop of heavy rains, a BMC official said. The IMD said that till 6.30 am on Sunday, Mumbai and adjoining areas received over 120 mm rainfall in preceding 12 hours. Mumbai would receive heavy to very heavy rainfall at a few places with extremely heavy rainfall at isolated places, the IMD said. Extremely heavy rainfall means precipitation of more than 204.5 mm in 24 hours, while heavy rainfall ranges between 115.6 mm to 204.4 mm rainfall, as per the IMD. The bulletin issued at 3 am said IMD recorded 213 mm rainfall at Santacruz, 197.5 mm at Bandra and 174 mm at Colaba in the city.  The suburban train services on both Central Railway and Western Railway in the financial capital were suspended due to water logging in the tracks due to the overnight heavy downpour, railway officials said. A sudden change in climatic conditions led to Mumbai witnessing over 100 mm rainfall in six hours, the IMD said in an early morning bulletin. It also changed the rains forecast for the city from orange to red alert.

Even as the three-member AICC panel was in the process of submitting its report on infighting in the Punjab Congress to the high command, a combative Chief Minister Capt Amarinder Singh has started pulling in regional leaders for help to counter newly-turned ‘dissident’ leaders in the party.  Sources said that the CM has appointed Sukhjinder Raj Singh alias Lalli Majithia, a veteran leader from the politically significant Majha region as the Chairman of the Punjab State Grain Procurement Corporation (Pungrain), an important body that draws linkages to the farmers in the state. The post had fallen vacant after the death of former Chief Secretary YS Ratra in April.  On the face of it, party insiders say, the appointment would seem a routine one but this one has major strategic political ramification. One, to tide over resentment among a section of the party that the CM was not ‘listening’ to the demands of the regional leaders, the CM was now making political appointments to boards and corporation rather than get bureaucrats to run them.  Secondly, Lalli Majithia, according to party sources, has been the biggest counter to senior Akal Dal leader Bikram Singh Majithia in the Majha region. “This can take the sting out of the allegations that Captain was soft on Akalis and was shying away from propping up leaders who are taking them head-on,’’ commented a party leader.  The move also, according to sources, helps the CM counter the Majha brigade in the Punjab Congress. Cabinet ministers Tript Rajinder Bajwa, Sukhbinder Singh Sarkaria and Sukhjinder Randhawa, along with some MLAs, who are seen as part of the Majha brigade, had reportedly joined hands with the dissidents against the CM.  These leaders, who form the core of the Majha leadership in the Congress, have till recently been siding with Capt Amarinder which has helped him neutralise the threat from the likes of Rajya Sabha MP Partap Singh Bajwa. But the recent cracks that have surfaced in the party over the sacrilege case handling has left the Majha brigade on the other side of the fence leaving the Captain camp worried.  “Now, since it’s increasingly getting clear that the Captain is staying as the CM, he needs to look at a new local leadership from politically important regions like Majha which will help him neutralise to some extent the threats from dissidents,” commented a senior party leader.

The United Nations General Assembly proclaimed July 15 in 2014 as World Youth Skills Day to recognise the strategic significance of preparing young people for work environments, dignified labour, and entrepreneurship. Ever since, World Youth Skills Day activities have given a unique chance of interaction among young people, technical and vocational education and training (TVET) institutions, businesses, employer and worker groups, regulators, and development agencies. Participants emphasised the ever-increasing importance of skills as the world moves toward a more sustainable style of development.  During the COVID-19 outbreak, India’s developing Technical and Vocational Education and Training (TVET) ecosystem encountered several obstacles. Organizations were forced to remain closed for 7-8 months, till September 2020, due to the nationwide lockdown.  This ecosystem includes a variety of players, like vocational education providers including such schools and higher education institutions; short-term skill development programmes endorsed by charitable donations and the National Skill Development Corporation (NSDC); and public and private Industrial Training Institutes (ITI).  Some main challenges and obstacles are as follow:  SHIFT TO ONLINE PLATFORMS Despite the fact that internet availability in India has risen from 27 percent to 50 percent in the last five years, the majority of youngsters who participate in skill development programmes have extremely limited access to smartphones and web access. Prior to the announcement of the nationwide lockdown last year, 25-30% of pupils did not own smartphones.  The epidemic has increased the digital divide between these pupils and those with wealth. It was tough to reach them through any type of internet programme.  FEWER JOB OPPORTUNITIES When the lockdown was relaxed from across the nation, job placements—a critical indication of success for all short-term training programs—were negatively impacted. This was mostly due to a few factors. First, there was a negative impact on the demand-supply cycle, resulting in fewer employment vacancies. Second, the worry of contracting COVID-19 caused several children and their parents to postpone placements.  Third, a lack of transportation infrastructure, particularly public transportation, which is the preferred method of transportation for the vast majority of Indians, made traveling to businesses problematic even for students who had accepted a job offer.  LOW ON FUNDS When the lockdown was prolonged in September-October 2020, financial sources for all government-sponsored programmes were mostly unavailable. Smaller skill development organisations were put under a lot of chronic stress, and they were compelled to reduce their project personnel.  During this period, several of the Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR) foundations have given their charity partners a lot of leeway to test new techniques, such as virtual delivery and expanding digital infrastructure assistance.

They don’t know what is going on. And all this amid the prime minister’s warning against third Covid wave, and saying that we cannot compromise even one bit," said Justice Nariman while issuing the notice.  The Yogi Adityanath government on Tuesday allowed the yatra from July 25 despite concerns raised in various quarters over the risk posed by such events in triggering a possible third wave of Covid-19.  “This is a matter of people’s faith. The government only makes the arrangements for this. It is only on the basis of arrangements by the government that we have defeated the first and the second wave of coronavirus. The notice by the Supreme Court has come to my knowledge, we will file our reply after discussion with the chief minister," UP health minister Jai Pratap Singh said.

The land area of the city swelled by almost 50 sq.km in less than three decades since 1991, the report said. But the real issue is, of course, that most of the reclaimed land is essentially low lying and, hence, flood prone. The average height from sea level along some stretches is less than 1 metre, the report said. It doesn’t help when torrential downpours are accompanied by high tides.   CLOGGED RIVERS: Once these would have done the work of stormwater drains, but illegal construction, encroachments, and pollution have turned Mumbai’s rivers into shadows of their former selves. According to the Mongabay report, “one of the major rivers, Mithi, has become a veritable sewer, choked with domestic and industrial waste and overflows every monsoon”. Similar is the situation with the other rivers like Dahisar, Poisar and Oshiwara. Not only that, the wetlands along these rivers are now practically non-existent, which means that there is no buffer between the waterline and adjoining localities. When the rivers overflow, they automatically lead to flooding in such localities.  STORMWATER DRAINAGE: A 2019 report by the Comptroller and Auditor General (CAG) on the flood preparedness of Mumbai had pointed to “major deficiencies” with the drainage system. One of the factors it had flagged was the delay in upgrades to city’s floodwater drainage system. The Brihanmumbai Storm Water Disposal System, or BRIMSTOWAD project, was conceptualised in 1993 but was reportedly taken up only after the devastating 2005 floods that hit Mumbai. The works to complete the project are said to be ongoing even as the CAG had highlighted serious issues in the report. Among these were heavy silting of the drains and obstructions caused by construction and dumping of waste. An added worry, the report said, was that the major outlets to flush the water away were all below sea level, which means that on high-tide or heavy rainfall days, these drains are incapable of clearing out the water. The report had also noted that the capacity of the drains was to deal with rainfall of the level of 25mm an hour. But the reality is that as of 2019, work was still ongoing to increase that capacity for rainfall of 50mm per hour.   MANGROVE FORESTS: Alleged deforestation of coastal mangrove belts has also been cited by environmentalists as a big contributor to frequent flooding. The Mongabay report had cited research by Mumbai-based environmental group Vanashakti that the city had “lost 40% of its mangrove forest cover between the early 1990s and 2005”. Although that estimate was contradicted by the government’s State of Forest report 2017 that their spread had actually increased since 2015, activists say that the present mangrove cover is not adequate for a city that is one of the wettest of India’s metros.

Dr VK Paul, NITI Aayog, Member [Health] says next 100-125 days are crucial for India.  The decline in cases in the country is slow; a warning amid the impending third wave of the pandemic, the government said on Friday, adding that the next three to four months were ‘critical’ for the fight against Covid-19.  In a Health Ministry briefing on Friday, Joint Secretary (Health) Lav Agarwal said the arrival of the third wave of Covid-19 would depend on people’s behaviour and the number of vaccinations administered in the country.  India witnessed a devastating second wave of the pandemic in April and May this year, which saw record infections and deaths, as people struggled for healthcare facilities and medical oxygen. Experts forewarn that another wave of Covid-19 may hit the country in August or October, this time affecting children more.  The second wave had prompted rigourous lockdowns in various states. However, as cases come down and restrictions are relaxed, a drop in adherence to Covid-appropriate protocol is also being witnessed. According to Agarwal, analysis shows a projected decline in the use of face masks as activities resume. “We should incorporate the use of face masks in our lives as a new normal," he said.  Social Media Misinformation on Covid 'Killing People'  Mask usage surged from March-April and peaked in May, during the peak of the second wave, but then began to fall in June and July, according to a graph depicting the decline in mask usage. According to projections, mask use will continue to drop in August and September, the government said.  Many people are also thronging hill stations in huge numbers after the relaxations. The Health Ministry, and Prime Minister Narendra Modi have reiterated warnings in recent days against such behaviour. “Forty-seven districts in India are reporting more than 10% positivity for the week ending July 15. The pandemic is far from over, a surge in cases is being noted globally. India is still amid a second wave," said Agarwal.  NITI Aayog Member Dr VK Paul said: “our decline in cases has slowed down, it’s a warning signal. The next 100 to 125 days are critical for the fight against Covid-19 in India."  Citing an ICMR study conducted in Tamil Nadu, the official added that one dose of the vaccine was able to reduce mortality rate by 82% in high-risk police personnel. “Two doses of vaccine were successful in preventing 95% of deaths due to Covid-19 during the second wave," he said.  Paul said the Prime Minister had asked the government to ensure that a third wave of Covid-19 did not arrive in the country.

Is UK taking a huge risk?  The UK government on Monday confirmed it will lift most of England’s coronavirus restrictions next week after a mass vaccination programme, but stressed the pandemic was far from over.  British health minister Sajid Javid urged people on Monday to show caution when nearly all the remaining COVID-19 restrictions are lifted in England next week, saying an increase in cases underlined that the pandemic was by no means over.  England will be the first nation in Britain to lift the legal requirement to wear masks and for people to socially distance from July 19, Javid announced.  But what was once billed as “freedom day" is now being treated with greater wariness by the government after a surge in cases and fears that there could be as many as 100,000 new infections a day over the summer.

Dr VK Paul, NITI Aayog, Member [Health] says next 100-125 days are crucial for India.  The decline in cases in the country is slow; a warning amid the impending third wave of the pandemic, the government said on Friday, adding that the next three to four months were ‘critical’ for the fight against Covid-19.  In a Health Ministry briefing on Friday, Joint Secretary (Health) Lav Agarwal said the arrival of the third wave of Covid-19 would depend on people’s behaviour and the number of vaccinations administered in the country.  India witnessed a devastating second wave of the pandemic in April and May this year, which saw record infections and deaths, as people struggled for healthcare facilities and medical oxygen. Experts forewarn that another wave of Covid-19 may hit the country in August or October, this time affecting children more.  The second wave had prompted rigourous lockdowns in various states. However, as cases come down and restrictions are relaxed, a drop in adherence to Covid-appropriate protocol is also being witnessed. According to Agarwal, analysis shows a projected decline in the use of face masks as activities resume. “We should incorporate the use of face masks in our lives as a new normal," he said.  Social Media Misinformation on Covid 'Killing People'  Mask usage surged from March-April and peaked in May, during the peak of the second wave, but then began to fall in June and July, according to a graph depicting the decline in mask usage. According to projections, mask use will continue to drop in August and September, the government said.  Many people are also thronging hill stations in huge numbers after the relaxations. The Health Ministry, and Prime Minister Narendra Modi have reiterated warnings in recent days against such behaviour. “Forty-seven districts in India are reporting more than 10% positivity for the week ending July 15. The pandemic is far from over, a surge in cases is being noted globally. India is still amid a second wave," said Agarwal.  NITI Aayog Member Dr VK Paul said: “our decline in cases has slowed down, it’s a warning signal. The next 100 to 125 days are critical for the fight against Covid-19 in India."  Citing an ICMR study conducted in Tamil Nadu, the official added that one dose of the vaccine was able to reduce mortality rate by 82% in high-risk police personnel. “Two doses of vaccine were successful in preventing 95% of deaths due to Covid-19 during the second wave," he said.  Paul said the Prime Minister had asked the government to ensure that a third wave of Covid-19 did not arrive in the country.

Punjab Congress heads for a massive reshuffle with the announcement of Navjyot Singh Sidhu as PCC Chief expected as early as today. Punjab Chief Minister Captain Amarinder Singh on Friday wrote a letter expressing his ‘displeasure’ to Sonia Gandhi, amid speculations of Navjot Singh Sidhu being named the Congress’ state chief as party in-fighting continues.  Supporters arrived at Navjot Singh Sidhu‘s residence on Friday, and fed each other sweets while awaiting an official announcement on the matter.  Supporters gathered outside Navjot Singh Sidhu’s residence. (News18) The letter mentions how the party would be harmed in the state if Sidhu is made president. Current Congress chief Harish Rawat will also visit Chandigarh on Saturday to meet Singh.  According to the CM, Sidhu’s working style would hurt the Congress. “Old party members will be angry, and the Congress will be split due to this," he said in the letter.  Sidhu on Friday had met party chief Sonia Gandhi at her residence. Former Congress president Rahul Gandhi and Rawat were also present during the meeting.  The meeting came ahead of the party’s Punjab unit revamp. After the meeting, Rawat said Sonia Gandhi is yet to take a final decision on the issue and he will share it soon after it is done. Asked whether a decision to appoint Sidhu as Punjab Congress chief has been made, Rawat said, “Who says this?"   “I had come here to submit my report on Punjab to the Congress chief and as soon as a decision is taken by the Congress President, I will come and share it with you," Rawat said. “Please read my statement very carefully and try and understand the words and their meaning," he also said.  Sidhu, however, had left Sonia Gandhi’s 10, Janpath residence without talking to the media.  Rawat had maintained that the central leadership was working out a peace formula where both Singh and Sidhu could work together to help the party win in the Punjab Assembly polls next year.  Meanwhile, the Punjab chief minister’s media adviser on Thursday evening had said Amarinder Singh will take the Congress to victory in the Assembly polls next year, trashing reports that he has resigned. He had also urged the media to stop speculating and spreading misinformation, saying the CM has neither quit nor offered to do so.  The remarks came amid media reports that Amritsar MLA Navjot Singh Sidhu was likely to be announced the Punjab Congress chief by the party high command. Sidhu has been at loggerheads with the CM as he attacked him over the alleged delay in justice in the 2015 desecration cases.  The Congress leadership has been working out a formula for Chief Minister Amarinder Singh and Sidhu to work together. The party had set up a three-member panel, headed by Leader of Opposition in Rajya Sabha Mallikarjun Kharge, to resolve the infighting in the Punjab Congress. The party high command has been trying to resolve the internal rift in the Punjab unit, with just months to go before the next Assembly polls.

A total of 16,35,591 beneficiaries in the age group of 18-44 years received the first dose and 2,11,553 were administered the second dose of the vaccine on Friday, the ministry said.  Cumulatively, 12,16,46,175 people in the 18-44 age group have received the first dose and 45,98,664 have received the second dose across the 37 states and Union territories since the start of the third phase of the nationwide vaccination drive, it added. The ministry said a total of 39,93,62,514 Covid vaccine doses have so far been administered in the country.  More than 38.79 lakh (38,79,917) vaccine doses were administered on Friday, according to a provisional report compiled at 7 pm. Eight states — Uttar Pradesh, Madhya Pradesh, Rajasthan, Tamil Nadu, Bihar, Gujarat, Karnataka and Maharashtra — have vaccinated more than 50 lakh beneficiaries each in the 18-44 age group for the first dose of the vaccine.   Andhra Pradesh, Assam, Chhattisgarh, Delhi, Haryana, Jharkhand, Kerala, Telangana, Himachal Pradesh, Odisha, Punjab, Uttarakhand and West Bengal have vaccinated more than 10 lakh beneficiaries each in the 18-44 age group for the first dose of the vaccine, the ministry said. Anew study by the Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR) has found that fewer hopsitalisations (9.8%) and deaths (0.4%) were reported in people having experienced breakthrough Covid-19 infection after two doses of a vaccine. The research indicates that a majority of the clinical cases of breakthrough infection involved the Delta variant. The study also underscores that vaccination does cut down chances of hospital admission and death.  “During March to June 2021, India has experienced a deadly second wave of Covid-19 with an increased number of post-vaccination breakthrough infections reported across the country. To understand the possible reason of these breakthroughs, we collected 677 clinical samples (throat swab/ nasal swabs) of individuals who had received two doses (n=592) and one dose (n=85) of vaccines (Covishield and Covaxin,) and tested positive for Covid-19, from 17 states/Union Territories of country,” says the preprint study.  A breakthrough case is when a fully vaccinated person later (more than 14 days after) gets the disease that the inoculation was for.   “It was observed that southern, western, eastern and north-western regions of India predominantly reported breakthrough infections from mainly Delta and then Kappa variant of SARS-CoV-2. The northern and central regions reported such infections due to Alpha, Delta and Kappa variants; however, cases due to Alpha variant predominated in the northern region. The overall majority (86.09%) of the breakthrough infections were caused by the Delta variant (B.1.617.2) of SARS-CoV-2 in different regions of India except for the northern region where the Alpha variant predominated,” the researchers say. Punjab Chief Minister Captain Amarinder Singh on Friday wrote a letter expressing his ‘displeasure’ to Sonia Gandhi, amid speculations of Navjot Singh Sidhu being named the Congress’ state chief as party in-fighting continues.  Supporters arrived at Navjot Singh Sidhu‘s residence on Friday, and fed each other sweets while awaiting an official announcement on the matter.

Though many blamed the late monsoons, the AAP targeted the BJP led Haryana Govt for not releasing water on time. Delhi Jal Board (DJB) vice chairman Raghav Chadha on Friday said the water level at the Wazirabad pond, one of the most important reservoirs in the capital, has increased from 667 feet to 674.5 feet, with Haryana releasing the city's legitimate share of water. Chadha, who took stock of the situation at the Wazirabad Barrage on Friday, said 16,000 cusec water, which was released by the neighbouring state three days ago, has reached Delhi and the water treatment plants in the capital are operating at optimum levels. "I salute the people of Delhi for their struggle. DJB along with the people of Delhi - finally managed to compel Haryana to release Delhi's rightful share of water in Yamuna, to the tune of 16,000 cusec," he tweeted.  "As a result, all our water treatment plants are now operating at optimum levels, and @DelhiJalBoard is working 24×7 to clean, filter & supply water to every household in Delhi," Chadha said. Now, the Wazirabad pond is full, water level is back at 674.5 ft as against 667 ft. Things are normalizing, he added.   The water from Wazirabad pond is drawn for treatment at Wazirabad, Okhla and Chandrawal treatment plants. The treated water is then supplied to central, south and west Delhi. According to Chadha, water levels of the Yamuna at the Wazirabad Barrage had hit the lowest mark in 56 years on Monday, with Haryana withholding Delhi's legitimate share of water. Delhi grappled with a water crisis with Haryana withholding at least 120 MGD water that belonged to the city, he had said. The DJB had on Sunday moved the Supreme Court, seeking directions to Haryana to release the capital's share of water.  The utility supplies 935 MGD of water to city residents against the demand of 1,150 MGD. At present, Delhi has been receiving 479 MGD against 609 MGD from Haryana. Besides, Delhi draws 90 MGD groundwater and receives 250 MGD from the Upper Ganga Canal.

Navjot Singh Sidhu’s impending appointment as the President of the Punjab Pradesh Congress Committee (PPCC) could mean he would be Captain Amarinder Singh’s successor and maybe the Chief Minister of the state sometime in the future if the Congress wins in 2022 in Punjab.  Chief Minister Captain Amarinder Singh’s media advisor on Thursday said Singh “will lead the party to victory in the 2022 polls as he did in 2017”, implying that 79-year-old Singh is in no mood to hang his boots. The party is going into the elections with Singh as the CM but Sidhu’s probable appointment as the PPCC Chief clears the succession path for the party in Punjab as the High Command does see Sidhu as the “future”. Who becomes the CM also depends on whom the majority of MLAs support, which is presently enjoyed by Captain Amarinder Singh.  There are latest precedents in the Congress of PCC Chiefs becoming the CMs if a majority of the winning MLAs back the person, which is sometimes the case as the PCC Chief has a major say in deciding tickets.

"The BJP is now using impartial agencies to settle political scores and malign our state. The NHRC should have respected the court. Instead of leaking the findings to the media, it should have first submitted the same to the court.

Chief Minister Captain Amarinder Singh’s media advisor on Thursday said Singh “will lead the party to victory in the 2022 polls as he did in 2017”, implying that 79-year-old Singh is in no mood to hang his boots. The party is going into the elections with Singh as the CM but Sidhu’s probable appointment as the PPCC Chief clears the succession path for the party in Punjab as the High Command does see Sidhu as the “future”. Who becomes the CM also depends on whom the majority of MLAs support, which is presently enjoyed by Captain Amarinder Singh.  There are latest precedents in the Congress of PCC Chiefs becoming the CMs if a majority of the winning MLAs back the person, which is sometimes the case as the PCC Chief has a major say in deciding tickets. In fact, before the 2017 assembly elections in Punjab in a similar set of circumstances, Captain Amarinder Singh had forced the Congress High Command to appoint him as the PPCC Chief replacing Partap Singh Bajwa, his known detractor. Singh got the post and later Rahul Gandhi also announced him as the CM face just on the eve of the elections. Now, Sidhu seems to be forcing the High Command’s hand to extend him the same favour.

BCCI president Sourav Ganguly will be a busy man in the upcoming months. Not that he had some free-time but with the organisation of back-to-back high profile events that will see involvement of players from across the globe during coronvirus pandemic is quite a challenge. In mid of September, the second leg of IPL 2021 will resume in UAE and just a couple of days after it concludes, the T20 World Cup will get underway. Even though the world cup has been shifted outside India, BCCI continues to be the official host and thus needs to ensure everything is in order well in advance.

With American troops in the process of withdrawing from Afghanistan after nearly two decades, the Taliban has made quick gains, overrunning several districts. An eruption of violence has lent an urgency to efforts to find a negotiated end to the country’s continued conflict. Talks between the government and insurgent forces have made little headway so far. CNN-News18 Security Affairs Editor Manoj Gupta spoke to Mohammad Suhail Shaheen, member of the Taliban negotiating team and spokesman of the political office of the Islamic Emirate of Afghanistan (IEA), who outlined the outlook for the trouble-torn nation, how his side expects to usher in peace, and the contours of relations with India and Pakistan.  We have seen a positive gesture by the Taliban recently where they have given assurances to foreign missions, foundations and other NGOs working in Kabul that they are safe. How do you see this? Is this a genuine bid to engage the international community or an act in fear that they withdraw and that would lead to the questioning of the Taliban motives? Or is it just a way to ensure that the world doesn’t turn its back on Afghanistan?   As per our policy, we don’t target embassies, consulates and NGOs. We only attack military forces of the Kabul administration that are engaged in fighting with us. We want to have relations with the international community and the world. We are an Islamic liberation force that has fought against the occupation for the last 20 years to gain independence. It is our legitimate right. No one should worry that we will pose a threat to them. After gaining independence, we will focus on the reconstruction of our country and maintain good relations with the world on the basis of mutual respect and interests.  We have seen Afghan forces surrendering before the Taliban onslaught in Afghanistan. The Taliban is taking their weapons and even fighting vehicles are confiscated. Don’t you think you are making Afghanistan a weak nation by this kind of display? What is the possibility that the Afghan army and the Taliban become a consolidated force and are absorbed as part of national reconciliation? What will be the future shape of the Afghan army? Will it just be the Taliban or will the ANA troops be part of the new army? Don’t you think if thousands of soldiers are demobilised, they could become a source of instability?   Most of the districts falling to us recently was the result of negotiations and intermediation of religious scholars and tribal elders. Hundreds of armed forces of the Kabul administration joined us voluntarily. All weapons, whether heavy weapons or light ones, that were handed over to us, are duly registered and kept securely. There is no risk of their being lost or damaged. Many of the current Afghan forces can be part of the future Afghan army after vetting when a new Islamic government is in place. They are Afghans and have the right to serve their country, but right now, they should stop killing their own people for the sake of prolongation of a moribund foreign-installed regime.  In an earlier interview to us, you had said that this time the Taliban will be different. You also said that the world is changing and you too have to change. But there is evidence, including videos, of women being punished openly even for small indiscretions by the Taliban.

With the wide prevalence of the Delta variant, the Manipur Government has announced a total curfew for 10 days, starting July 18.  Meanwhile, the Sikkim government imposed a ban on all socio-religious and entertainment-related activities for a month due to the prevailing COVID-19 situation. The decision was taken at a high-level meeting, chaired by Sikkim Chief Minister Prem Singh Tamang. According to officials, marriage ceremonies, pujas, birthday parties, and get-togethers will remain banned for the next 30 days, both in urban and rural areas of the Himalayan state.  Meanwhile, the Supreme Court bench of Justices R F Nariman and B R Gavai said, it fixed July 16 for the matter to be heard next, pointing out that “it is necessary to fix a short time period for this case” as the Yatra is set to take off from July 25. Experts have termed Kanwar Yatra as a ‘superspreader’ and said the footfall would be much more than Kumbh Mela. However, Uttar Pradesh chief minister Yogi Adityanath has urged that only a minimum number of people should participate in the annual Kanwar Yatra and directed strict implementation of the COVID-19 protocol. The government added that negative RT-PCR test report can be made compulsory for pilgrims, if required.

Apart from Capt Amarinder Singh as the CM and Navjot Singh Sidhu as the PCC chief, Punjab Congress will also have two working presidents from the Hindu and Dalit communities.

No other state outside the north east is showing such growth in new Covid-19 cases. The Indian Council of Medical Research has projected, in some scenarios, that India's third wave could begin as early as August. Could the rise in Kerala then be heralding the start of the third wave in India?  Unlikely, say health experts, pointing to the absence of a steep rise in infections. Cases are increasing at a slow rate in Kerala, despite the relaxation of lockdown restrictions and the rise of the more transmissible Delta variant in the state, they tell us. "Mobility is up, people are mixing and with Delta [variant dominating], the numbers should be shooting up, not stabilising," Rajeev Sadanandan, the chief executive of Health Systems Transformation Platform (HSTP), a New Delhi-based nonprofit, and Kerala's former additional chief secretary of health, told IndiaSpend

Party sources had earlier revealed that Sidhu was not keen to accept anything less than the post of Punjab Congress president or deputy chief minister, but that could create two power centres in the state ahead of the crucial elections. However, not giving the Amritsar MLA what he wants could also end up in Sidhu deserting the party.  This also seemed to play out recently when Sidhu praised the Aam Aadmi Party in what was seen an attempt to cozy up to the Arvind Kejriwal-led outfit. In a series of tweets on Tuesday, Sidhu said: “Our opposition AAP has always recognised my vision & work for Punjab. Be it Before 2017- Beadbi, Drugs, Farmers Issues, Corruption & Power Crisis faced by People of Punjab raised by me or today as I present “Punjab Model” It is clear they know - who is really fighting for Punjab.” He also tagged an old news clip when he had resigned from the BJP and reports had indicated that he could join the AAP.  the National Human Rights Commission (NHRC) on Thursday submitted a 50-page report on alleged post-poll violence in West Bengal before a five-judge bench of the Calcutta High Court and recommended a CBI probe into it.  Hitting out at Trinamool Congress chief Mamata Banerjee, the NHRC observed that West Bengal has ‘law of the ruler’, and not ‘rule of law’.  While recommending a CBI probe in all the post-poll violence cases in Bengal, NHRC has urged the Court that the trial should be outside the jurisdiction of West Bengal. The NHRC also mentioned that Bengal police were not co-operative and they found them biased while tackling the situation.

The TFR - average number of children born to a woman in her reproductive years - had dropped from 4.06 (1999) to 2.7 (2016) in 17 years in UP, while that of India dropped by just 0.7 during the same period, official data shows.  As per Uttar Pradesh’s new population policy, the government aims to achieve a TFR of 2.1 — also the replacement level fertility (RLF) — by 2026. Among the targets is to bring the TFR to 1.9 by 2030, as well.  The RLF is the level at which a population exactly replaces itself from one generation to the next. So, for the population in a given area to remain stable, an overall total fertility rate of 2.1 is needed.

The shooting put behind the disappointment of Rio and turn it around.  They have as many as 3 world number ones going in and some of the hottest shooters in the world in the squad. This is India's biggest and possibly strongest contingent at the Olympics ever.  And India is pipped to win anywhere from 15-17 medals if all goes to plan.  From olive wreaths to recycled metals sourced from old cell phones and electronics, the reward for winning at the Olympics, the most sought-after achievement in an athlete’s life, has come a long way, much like the Games itself. Made of recycled electronic devices and pebble-like in appearance, the medals in the upcoming Tokyo Games will measure 8.5 centimeters in diameter, featuring the flying image of Nike, the Greek goddess of victory. But, unlike previous years, these will be produced from gold, silver and bronze (in this case, copper and zinc) that has been stripped from over 79,000 tons of used cell phones and other small electronic devices donated by the Japanese population.  During the ancient Olympic Games, athletes who emerged victorious were awarded ‘Kotinos’ or olive wreaths, which were considered a sacred prize in Greece, representing the highest honour. In 1896, the long-lost tradition of ancient Greece, the Olympic Games was reborn in Athens.  With the rebirth, new practices made way for older ones and thus the custom of awarding medals began — silver for the winners while the runners-up received a copper or bronze medal. On the front of the medal was Zeus, father of the gods and in whose honour the Games were held, holding Nike, while the reverse side showed the Acropolis.  It wasn’t until eight years later in the 1904 St. Louis Games, where the now standard gold, silver, and bronze medals, were first used. The metals represent the first three ages of man in Greek mythology: the Golden Age — when men lived among the gods, the Silver Age — where youth lasted a hundred years, and the Bronze Age, or the age of heroes.  Over the next century, the coveted awards would vary in shape, size, weight, composition, and in the image they carried. In 1923, the International Olympic Committee (IOC) launched a competition for sculptors to design the medals for the Summer Games.  The Italian artist Giuseppe Cassioli’s design was chosen as the winner in 1928. The obverse of the medal was embossed with Nike holding a palm in her left hand and the crown for the winner in the right, with a depiction of the Colosseum in the background and the reverse featured a crowd of people carrying a triumphant athlete.  This design continued for a considerable time. While host cities were allowed to rework the reverse of the medal starting from the 1972 Munich Games, the obverse only changed during the 2004 Athens Olympics.  A new depiction of Nike, flying into the 1896 Panathenaic Stadium to bestow victory on the strongest, highest and fastest, replaced the older one. Until 1960, winners had medals pinned to them but the Rome Olympics had the necklace-like design allowing the athletes to wear the prized possession around their necks thanks to a chain.  Four years later, the chain made way for coloured ribbons. Interestingly, the gold medals are not made of the yellow metal entirely. The 1912 Stockholm Games was the last time an Olympic medal was made entirely out of the metal. Now, they are just plated with it.  As per the IOC guidelines, a gold medal must contain a minimum of 6 grams of gold. In reality, silver forms the bulk of the medal. China, which hosted the 2008 Beijing Olympics, for the first time, introduced medals made of a material other than metal — jade.

With American troops in the process of withdrawing from Afghanistan after nearly two decades, the Taliban has made quick gains, overrunning several districts. An eruption of violence has lent an urgency to efforts to find a negotiated end to the country’s continued conflict. Talks between the government and insurgent forces have made little headway so far. CNN-News18 Security Affairs Editor Manoj Gupta spoke to Mohammad Suhail Shaheen, member of the Taliban negotiating team and spokesman of the political office of the Islamic Emirate of Afghanistan (IEA), who outlined the outlook for the trouble-torn nation, how his side expects to usher in peace, and the contours of relations with India and Pakistan.  We have seen a positive gesture by the Taliban recently where they have given assurances to foreign missions, foundations and other NGOs working in Kabul that they are safe. How do you see this? Is this a genuine bid to engage the international community or an act in fear that they withdraw and that would lead to the questioning of the Taliban motives? Or is it just a way to ensure that the world doesn’t turn its back on Afghanistan?   As per our policy, we don’t target embassies, consulates and NGOs. We only attack military forces of the Kabul administration that are engaged in fighting with us. We want to have relations with the international community and the world. We are an Islamic liberation force that has fought against the occupation for the last 20 years to gain independence. It is our legitimate right. No one should worry that we will pose a threat to them. After gaining independence, we will focus on the reconstruction of our country and maintain good relations with the world on the basis of mutual respect and interests.  We have seen Afghan forces surrendering before the Taliban onslaught in Afghanistan. The Taliban is taking their weapons and even fighting vehicles are confiscated. Don’t you think you are making Afghanistan a weak nation by this kind of display? What is the possibility that the Afghan army and the Taliban become a consolidated force and are absorbed as part of national reconciliation? What will be the future shape of the Afghan army? Will it just be the Taliban or will the ANA troops be part of the new army? Don’t you think if thousands of soldiers are demobilised, they could become a source of instability?   Most of the districts falling to us recently was the result of negotiations and intermediation of religious scholars and tribal elders. Hundreds of armed forces of the Kabul administration joined us voluntarily. All weapons, whether heavy weapons or light ones, that were handed over to us, are duly registered and kept securely. There is no risk of their being lost or damaged. Many of the current Afghan forces can be part of the future Afghan army after vetting when a new Islamic government is in place. They are Afghans and have the right to serve their country, but right now, they should stop killing their own people for the sake of prolongation of a moribund foreign-installed regime.  In an earlier interview to us, you had said that this time the Taliban will be different. You also said that the world is changing and you too have to change. But there is evidence, including videos, of women being punished openly even for small indiscretions by the Taliban.

Yogi Adityanath government released a new policy to stabilise the population by bringing the total fertility rate (TFR) to 2.1 from its current value of 2.7 by 2026, official data analysed by CNN-News18 shows Uttar Pradesh has been witnessing a decline in the rate for the last several years.  The TFR - average number of children born to a woman in her reproductive years - had dropped from 4.06 (1999) to 2.7 (2016) in 17 years in UP, while that of India dropped by just 0.7 during the same period, official data shows.  As per Uttar Pradesh’s new population policy, the government aims to achieve a TFR of 2.1 — also the replacement level fertility (RLF) — by 2026. Among the targets is to bring the TFR to 1.9 by 2030, as well.  The RLF is the level at which a population exactly replaces itself from one generation to the next. So, for the population in a given area to remain stable, an overall total fertility rate of 2.1 is needed.

As the Yogi Adityanath government released a new policy to stabilise the population by bringing the total fertility rate (TFR) to 2.1 from its current value of 2.7 by 2026, official data analysed by CNN-News18 shows Uttar Pradesh has been witnessing a decline in the rate for the last several years.  The TFR - average number of children born to a woman in her reproductive years - had dropped from 4.06 (1999) to 2.7 (2016) in 17 years in UP, while that of India dropped by just 0.7 during the same period, official data shows.  As per Uttar Pradesh’s new population policy, the government aims to achieve a TFR of 2.1 — also the replacement level fertility (RLF) — by 2026. Among the targets is to bring the TFR to 1.9 by 2030, as well.  The RLF is the level at which a population exactly replaces itself from one generation to the next. So, for the population in a given area to remain stable, an overall total fertility rate of 2.1 is needed.

In its submissions to the state Law Commission, a copy of which was shared on its Twitter handle, the VHP said, “The preamble of Bill states that this is a Bill (i) inter alia to stabilize the population and (ii) promotion of two-child norm. VHP agrees with both objectives. However, Section 5, 6(2) and 7 of the Bill, which incentivise the public servants and others to have only one child in the family go well beyond the said objectives.”

This is India's biggest and possibly strongest contingent at the Olympics ever.  And India is pipped to win anywhere from 15-17 medals if all goes to plan. From olive wreaths to recycled metals sourced from old cell phones and electronics, the reward for winning at the Olympics, the most sought-after achievement in an athlete’s life, has come a long way, much like the Games itself. Made of recycled electronic devices and pebble-like in appearance, the medals in the upcoming Tokyo Games will measure 8.5 centimeters in diameter, featuring the flying image of Nike, the Greek goddess of victory. But, unlike previous years, these will be produced from gold, silver and bronze (in this case, copper and zinc) that has been stripped from over 79,000 tons of used cell phones and other small electronic devices donated by the Japanese population.  During the ancient Olympic Games, athletes who emerged victorious were awarded ‘Kotinos’ or olive wreaths, which were considered a sacred prize in Greece, representing the highest honour. In 1896, the long-lost tradition of ancient Greece, the Olympic Games was reborn in Athens.  With the rebirth, new practices made way for older ones and thus the custom of awarding medals began — silver for the winners while the runners-up received a copper or bronze medal. On the front of the medal was Zeus, father of the gods and in whose honour the Games were held, holding Nike, while the reverse side showed the Acropolis.  It wasn’t until eight years later in the 1904 St. Louis Games, where the now standard gold, silver, and bronze medals, were first used. The metals represent the first three ages of man in Greek mythology: the Golden Age — when men lived among the gods, the Silver Age — where youth lasted a hundred years, and the Bronze Age, or the age of heroes.  Over the next century, the coveted awards would vary in shape, size, weight, composition, and in the image they carried. In 1923, the International Olympic Committee (IOC) launched a competition for sculptors to design the medals for the Summer Games.  The Italian artist Giuseppe Cassioli’s design was chosen as the winner in 1928. The obverse of the medal was embossed with Nike holding a palm in her left hand and the crown for the winner in the right, with a depiction of the Colosseum in the background and the reverse featured a crowd of people carrying a triumphant athlete.  This design continued for a considerable time. While host cities were allowed to rework the reverse of the medal starting from the 1972 Munich Games, the obverse only changed during the 2004 Athens Olympics.  A new depiction of Nike, flying into the 1896 Panathenaic Stadium to bestow victory on the strongest, highest and fastest, replaced the older one. Until 1960, winners had medals pinned to them but the Rome Olympics had the necklace-like design allowing the athletes to wear the prized possession around their necks thanks to a chain.  Four years later, the chain made way for coloured ribbons. Interestingly, the gold medals are not made of the yellow metal entirely. The 1912 Stockholm Games was the last time an Olympic medal was made entirely out of the metal. Now, they are just plated with it.  As per the IOC guidelines, a gold medal must contain a minimum of 6 grams of gold. In reality, silver forms the bulk of the medal. China, which hosted the 2008 Beijing Olympics, for the first time, introduced medals made of a material other than metal — jade.

And India is pipped to win anywhere from 15-17 medals if all goes to plan. From olive wreaths to recycled metals sourced from old cell phones and electronics, the reward for winning at the Olympics, the most sought-after achievement in an athlete’s life, has come a long way, much like the Games itself. Made of recycled electronic devices and pebble-like in appearance, the medals in the upcoming Tokyo Games will measure 8.5 centimeters in diameter, featuring the flying image of Nike, the Greek goddess of victory. But, unlike previous years, these will be produced from gold, silver and bronze (in this case, copper and zinc) that has been stripped from over 79,000 tons of used cell phones and other small electronic devices donated by the Japanese population.  During the ancient Olympic Games, athletes who emerged victorious were awarded ‘Kotinos’ or olive wreaths, which were considered a sacred prize in Greece, representing the highest honour. In 1896, the long-lost tradition of ancient Greece, the Olympic Games was reborn in Athens.  With the rebirth, new practices made way for older ones and thus the custom of awarding medals began — silver for the winners while the runners-up received a copper or bronze medal. On the front of the medal was Zeus, father of the gods and in whose honour the Games were held, holding Nike, while the reverse side showed the Acropolis.  It wasn’t until eight years later in the 1904 St. Louis Games, where the now standard gold, silver, and bronze medals, were first used. The metals represent the first three ages of man in Greek mythology: the Golden Age — when men lived among the gods, the Silver Age — where youth lasted a hundred years, and the Bronze Age, or the age of heroes.

In 1923, the International Olympic Committee (IOC) launched a competition for sculptors to design the medals for the Summer Games.  The Italian artist Giuseppe Cassioli’s design was chosen as the winner in 1928. The obverse of the medal was embossed with Nike holding a palm in her left hand and the crown for the winner in the right, with a depiction of the Colosseum in the background and the reverse featured a crowd of people carrying a triumphant athlete.  This design continued for a considerable time. While host cities were allowed to rework the reverse of the medal starting from the 1972 Munich Games, the obverse only changed during the 2004 Athens Olympics.  A new depiction of Nike, flying into the 1896 Panathenaic Stadium to bestow victory on the strongest, highest and fastest, replaced the older one. Until 1960, winners had medals pinned to them but the Rome Olympics had the necklace-like design allowing the athletes to wear the prized possession around their necks thanks to a chain.  Four years later, the chain made way for coloured ribbons. Interestingly, the gold medals are not made of the yellow metal entirely. The 1912 Stockholm Games was the last time an Olympic medal was made entirely out of the metal. Now, they are just plated with it.  As per the IOC guidelines, a gold medal must contain a minimum of 6 grams of gold. In reality, silver forms the bulk of the medal. China, which hosted the 2008 Beijing Olympics, for the first time, introduced medals made of a material other than metal — jade.

Party sources had earlier revealed that Sidhu was not keen to accept anything less than the post of Punjab Congress president or deputy chief minister, but that could create two power centres in the state ahead of the crucial elections. However, not giving the Amritsar MLA what he wants could also end up in Sidhu deserting the party.  This also seemed to play out recently when Sidhu praised the Aam Aadmi Party in what was seen an attempt to cozy up to the Arvind Kejriwal-led outfit. In a series of tweets on Tuesday, Sidhu said: “Our opposition AAP has always recognised my vision & work for Punjab. Be it Before 2017- Beadbi, Drugs, Farmers Issues, Corruption & Power Crisis faced by People of Punjab raised by me or today as I present “Punjab Model” It is clear they know - who is really fighting for Punjab.” He also tagged an old news clip when he had resigned from the BJP and reports had indicated that he could join the AAP.
